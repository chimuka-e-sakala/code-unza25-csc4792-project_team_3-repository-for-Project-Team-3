"Comparison of Viral Load Suppression among HIV-1 Infected Children Aged 5 to 12 Years on Once Daily Versus Twice Daily Abacavir-Containing Regimens at University Teaching Hospitals - Children’s Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia",Mukumbi Mutenda; Derrick Munkombwe; Patrick Kaonga; Mukuka Mwamba,"Abacavir is one of the first-line drugs used to treat HIV infection in paediatric patients in Zambia, whose use in children has not been widely published. This study compared the virologic response of abacavir given as part of a once-daily regimen with the response when given as part of a twice-daily regimen. A total of eighty-two children aged two to twelve years currently receiving antiretroviral therapy at the Paediatric Centre of Excellence, University Teaching Hospitals, Lusaka, Zambia, were observed in the study. This was a prospective cohort study. All the children were initially on twice daily abacavir containing regimen with lamivudine twice daily and efavirenz once daily, with 40 maintained on this regimen by the attending clinician and 42 switched to once-daily abacavir, lamivudine and efavirenz by the attending clinician. Profiles were obtained for each child to compare viral load at baseline and week 24. Data was analysed using Stata Version 16.The proportion of children with undetectable viral load in the once-daily group at twenty-four weeks was 64.3 per cent compared to 72.5 per centin the twice-daily group. Twice-daily dosing reduced the odds of achieving an undetectable viral load by about 59 per cent, while being male reduced the odds of achieving an undetectable HIV viral load by 19.6 per cent. Baseline haemoglobin, creatinine, or alanine transferase levels were not predictors of viral load suppression.The study suggests that once-daily dosing of an abacavir-containing regimen achieved a lower viral suppression rate when compared to twice-daily dosing. It is recommended that once-daily dosing of abacavir containing regimen should be considered as a dosing option for Zambian children living with HIV.",General,6/1/2023
"Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices on Newcastle Disease Prevention in Poultry among Small Scale Poultry Farmers in Lusaka West, Zambia",Chilufya N Muya; Esther Munanjala; Bernadette M Mumba,"Introduction: Newcastle disease is a viral disease caused by virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains infecting avian species worldwide. Infected birds may show signs of loss of appetite, coughing, gasping, nasal discharge, watery eyes, and nervous signs such as paralysis and convulsions. The disease is spread primarily through direct contact between healthy birds and the bodily discharges of infected birds. The study assessed knowledge, attitudes, and practices on Newcastle disease prevention among small-scale poultry farmers in Lusaka West, Zambia.
Materials and methods: A quantitative descriptive cross-sectional study design, was used and the study was conducted in five areas of Lusaka West. Probability sampling method was utilized to select a sample size of 384 poultry farmers. Closed-ended structured questionnaires were used to collect data which was analyzed using descriptive analysis. 
Results: The study showed that the respondents had a good level of knowledge (58.8%); positive attitudes (71.1%); and positive practices (73.2%) on Newcastle disease prevention. 
Conclusion: The obtained results could be attributed to the levels of experience and fear of losing business profits due to bird mortalities as well as the level of experience most respondents had in poultry farming. This was observed by the significant association between knowledge and experience (p-value - 0.004). This calls for the promotion of awareness and knowledge on the importance of vaccination of birds as a means of prevention for Newcastle disease and enhancing Newcastle disease detection and control through rapid test kits & others.",Veterinary Medicine,7/5/2023
"Effects of High-Intensity Aerobic Interval Training on Cardiopulmonary Function in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure at The University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia",Mikoloni Mary Musonda; Nkhata A Loveness; Goma M Fastone,"Chronic   heart   failure   patients   present   with  various  symptoms,  such  as  fatigue  and   dyspnea,   adversely   affecting their  quality  of  life.  Heart  failure  is  a  complex  disease  and  a  major  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality  in  developed  and    developing    countries,    including    Zambia.   Through   studies   undertaken,   high-intensity  aerobic  interval  training  has  been  recommended  in  patients  with  chronic  heart  failure  to  help  improve  symptoms and, consequently, the quality of  life.  Minimal  research  pertaining  to  the  effectiveness  of  aerobic  exercise on    various    physiological    parameters    such   as   peripheral   oxygen   saturation,   cardiopulmonary capacity and quality of life have been done in Africa and Zambia. This study evaluated the physiological effects of high-intensity aerobic interval training on the cardiopulmonary function in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class  II  and  III  chronic  heart  failure  patients with a focus on peripheral oxygen delivery/saturation,       cardiopulmonary       capacity  and  the  quality  of  life.  This  study  utilised  the  Randomised  Clinical  Trial   (RCT)   study   design,   and   the   study  population  was  selected  from  the  University     Teaching     Hospital-Heart     Clinic in Lusaka, Zambia.A   total   number   of   42   patients   participated and were randomly assigned to the two arms of the study. Twenty-one (21)  were  assigned  to  the  interventional  group  (IG)  and  21  to  the  control  group  (CG),  respectively.  The  IG  underwent  a    12-week    aerobic    HIIT    exercise-training  programme,  while  the  CG  was  subjected  to  30  minutes  of  walking  on  a  treadmill  for  the  same  period  of  12  weeks.  The  expected  primary  outcomes  were the baseline to endline differences in  oxygen  delivery/saturation  readings,  cardiopulmonary  capacity  test  readings  and the quality of life (measured using the Minnesota questionnaire) for both groups. The   results   obtained   from   the   pulse   oximeter  readings  showed  an  increase  in the oxygen saturation readings (97.90 to   98.62%),   6-minute   walk   distance   readings  (360.05  m  to  429  m)  and  the  questionnaire score totals of the different dimensions  (physical,  emotional/mental  and  socio-psychological  factors)  of  the  questionnaire   (p-value;0.0001)   of   the   IG.  The  CG  oxygen  saturation  readings  (97.38   %   to   97.90%)   and   6-minute   walk  test  scores  (359.14  to  370.9  m)  showed   minimal   change.   While   the   questionnaire scores showed a statistical difference   in   the   emotional/mental (p-value  <  0.0001),  physical  (p=0.005) and  socio-psychological  factors  (p-value  < 0.0001). High-intensity aerobic interval training has shown to improve peripheral oxygen       delivery,       cardiopulmonary       capacity  and  quality  of  life  in  chronic  heart  failure  patients;  hence,  it  must  be  considered an adjunct therapy aside from pharmacological  management  in  stable  chronic heart failure patients in Zambia.",General,8/15/2023
Evaluation of Processing Methods for Increased Utilization of Velvet Beans (Mucuna pruriens) as an Alternative Protein Supplement in Diets for Lactating Crossbred Dairy Cows Maintained on Smallholder Farms in Zambia,Joseph Simbaya; M Mwape; Oswin C. Chibinga; Silvia J. Harrison; Francisco Kanyinji,"This study aimed at  evaluating   the   processing   methods   of   velvet   beans   (Mucuna     pruriens)     as a protein supplement  in  concentrates  for  cross-bred  dairy  cows  on  smallholder  farms  in  Zambia. The beans  were  harvested  by  pulling  entire  plants  after  drying  in  the field and divided into three portions; (i) whole crop consisting of vines, pods and  grains;  (ii) unshelled  pods  only;  and  (iii) grain  only. Each  portion  was  ground  to  pass  through  a  2mm  screen  before  using  it  to  make  concentrate  for  the feeding trial. Prior to the preparation of  rations,  samples  from  each  portion  were  collected  for  the  determination  of  nutrient  composition.  Each  ration  was  fed  to  a  group  of  cross-breed  milking  cows  maintained  on  a  farm  to  monitor  performance. Chemical    composition    analysis   showed   that   shelled   grains   had  more  nutrients  than  the  pods  and  vines. Milking  cows  readily  accepted  all  the  prepared  rations  and  maintained constant milk production throughout the study period. None of the animals on the trial exhibited any sign of ill-health. This showed that velvet beans could be fed to milking  cows  by  incorporating  ground  pods   with   other   ingredients   without   adversely  affecting  animal  health  or milk production.",Agriculture Sciences,7/13/2023
Growth Performance of Kuroiler (Rhode Island Red x White Leghorn) Chickens Fed Aflatoxin Contaminated Maize-Based Diets Treated with Different Amounts of Lemon (Limon Citrus) Juice,Francisco Kanyinji; Ketty Musukwa; Joseph Simbaya; Oswin Chibinga; Sylvia J Harrison; Joyce Mufungwe,"Aflatoxin contamination in feed and feed ingredients  is  prevalent  worldwide  and  poses serious risks to both livestock and humans. This study assessed the effects of feeding Aflatoxin (AF) contaminated maize-based  diets  treated  with  varying  levels   of   lemon   juice   to   Kuroiler   chickens’  growth  performance.  Lemon  juice was extracted from fruits purchased from  the  local  market  and  mixed  with  isocaloric and isonitrogenic     diets     (starter, grower and finisher) containing AF-contaminated  maize,  at  0,  250,  500  and 750ml lemon juice/Kg of feed. The diets were left to dry for 24 hours, after which   100g   samples   were   collected   from each diet to measure and compare the  residual  AF  levels.  Then,  100  day-old  Kuroiler  chicks  were  sourced  from  a  local  hatchery  and  divided  into  four  treatment  groups  (n  =  25).  Each  group  was replicated four times. The treatment groups  were  randomly  assigned  to  0,  250,  500,  and  750ml  lemon  juice/Kg  feed–treated diets. These feeds and clean drinking  water  were  supplied  to  the birds ad libitum for 49 days. Feed intake was monitored daily, and body weights, weight gains, and feed conversion ratios were  assessed  weekly.  It  was  observed  that  the  amount  of  residual  AF  in  each  diet  depended  on  the  amount  of  lemon  juice used to treat it. The untreated diet had  the  highest  AF  levels  at  36  ppb,  followed by that which was treated with 250, 500, and 750 ml lemon juice/Kg feed at 28.1, 21.3, and 7.4 ppb, respectively. Growth performance variables assessed were  also  influenced  by  the  amounts of  residual  AF  levels  in  the  diet.  Birds  fed  diets  with  the  lowest  residual  AF  levels at 7.4 ppb had the best (p < 0.05) growth performance in all the variables, while the least (p < 0.05) was observed in  birds  fed  untreated  diet,  followed  by  those  that  were  fed  diets  treated  with  250 and 500ml Lemon juice/kg feed. It was concluded that lemon juice was able to  degrade  AF  in  diets  that  had  maize  contaminated with AF, but the extent to which it inactivated it, depended on the amount of juiced used. Similarly, growth performance of birds fed diets with AF-contaminated maize treated with lemon juice  was  also  dependent  on  the  levels  of  residual  AF  in  feeds  after  treatment,  with  the  best  performance  observed  in  chickens  fed  diets  treated  with  750ml  lemon juice per kg feed.",Agriculture Sciences,8/4/2023
"Impacts of Personal Protective Equipment Utilisation on Prevention of Coronavirus Among Healthcare Workers in Kwara State, Nigeria",Kperogi Ismaila Ibrahim; Baba Dare Abubakar; Jamiu Abdulqudus Tosin; Ologele Ibrahim; Abdulrasaq Qazeem Onaolapo; Abdullahi Muhammed Bukola,"This study examined the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE) utilisation on the prevention  of  the  coronavirus  (COVID-19)  among   healthcare   workers   (HCWs)   in   Kwara  State,  Nigeria.  Personal  protective  equipment (PPE) means personal protective equipment,  which  are  devices  designed  to  protect healthcare workers from contracting infectious   diseases   during   the   treatment   of   patients   with   the   threaded   pandemic   COVID-19 infection. These instruments can be  hand  gloves,  nose  masks,  and  protective  footwear, among others. However, the effect of  the  non-utilisation  of  these  devices  can  be  devastating,  particularly  among  HCWs  treating coronavirus   patients   because   of   its  volatile  nature  of  transmission  through  airborne  and  contacts.  This  study  aims  at  determining if HCWs perceive that utilisation of  PPE  has  effects  on  the  prevention  of Coronavirus  (COVID-19)  in  Kwara  State,  Nigeria. A  descriptive  research  design  of  the  survey  type  was  used  for  this  study.  The  instrument used was a researchers’ structured questionnaire, which was validated by three experts  in  health  education.  A  multistage  sampling  procedure  to  sample  230  HCWs  from    Kwara    State    government-owned hospitals   was   used   for   this   study.   The   instrument was then subjected to a test re-test reliability  method  and  analysed  by  Pearson  Product  Moment  Correlation  Coefficient (PPMC), which yielded 0.81r, showing that the  instrument  was  reliable  enough  for  the  study. The data collected was analysed using descriptive   statistics   of   frequency   count,   simple percentage and inferential statistics of Chi-square (χ2) at 0.05 alpha level.Results revealed that HCWs significantly perceived that utilisation of PPE has an impact on  the  prevention  of  COVID-19  in  Kwara  State,  Nigeria,  with  a  calculated  χ2  value  of  146.174, which is greater than the critical table value of 43.773.It  was  concluded  that  HCWs  perceived  that the utilisation of PPE has an impact on the prevention of COVID-19 in Kwara State, Nigeria. It was, however, recommended that the government should increase the training of HCWs through seminars and workshops. More so, the government should provide and enforce the adequate use of PPE to be used by  HCWs  against  COVID-19  infection  in  Kwara State, Nigeria.",General,8/15/2023
"Household Energy Conservation Practices used in Chalimbana Ward, Chongwe District",Alfred Chewetu; Progress H Nyanga,"Energy conservation is a subject that has continued to attract global attention as it is essential in ensuring that the growing energy demand does not pose a threat to the environment. In view of this, the current study aimed at finding out the household energy conservation practices used in Chalimbana ward of Chongwe District, Zambia. The study adopted a convergent mixed-method research design. Qualitative data from 10 purposively sampled key informants was collected through in-depth interviews using semi-structured interview guides. Additionally, quantitative data from 175 households selected through cluster sampling technique was collected using a questionnaire. The qualitative data was analysed through content analysis, whereas quantitative data was analysed through descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression. 
The study found that most households in Chalimbana ward depend on traditional biomass energy (Charcoal and firewood). Through multiple linear regression, the study found that expenditure on household energy consumption in the study area is influenced by social and economic factors such as family size, house size and education. To conserve energy, the households in this area use a variety of conservation methods, of which the most used involves switching or putting off unused household energy appliances or sources. The energy used among these households causes air pollution, habitat loss, land use change, and exposure to hazardous waste, among other environmental atrocities. While the study findings show that households in Chalimbana ward do practice energy conservation, this is not done at a substantive level that can yield sustainable environmental, economic and social benefits of household energy conservation.",General,10/16/2023
Nutritive Value of Selected Naturally Growing Dry Season Pastures in Flood Plains of Kafue River in Southern Zambia,Smart Gondwe; Oswin Chifungwe Chibinga; Francisco Kanyinji,"Wetlands are an important source of pastures for livestock forage in the dry season in arid and semi-arid regions. In this study forage samples were collected during the dry season (September to November) to evaluate the nutritive value for potential to supply livestock requirements during dry season under the transhumance system of livestock production in the Kafue Flood Plains in Mazabuka district of  Southern Province. The frequency, height and cover of the grass species in upper and lower parts of the grazing area were measured. Proximate components, fibre fractions and in vitro dry matter digestibility were determined using standard laboratory procedures. The grass species found in the upper land were Acroceras macrum, and Vetiveria nigritana at the frequency of 60 and 56 percent, respectively. Panicum repens, Polygonum spp and Cyperus papyrus are the grass species that were found in the lower area at a frequency of 44, 52 and 80 percent. Ground cover was 69 and 100 % for upper and lower area, respectively. The Crude Protein was significantly different among the species Vetiveria nigritana (7.90%) and Polygonum salicifolium (8.46 %), Cyperus papyrus (6.12%) and were also higher than for Panicum repens (3.37%) and Acroceras macrum (3.32%) (p ˂ 0.05). Crude fiber ranged from 12.8% (Polygonum salicifolium) to 34.6% (Vetiveria nigritana).   Polygonum salicifolium had higher in vitro dry matter digestibility (INVDMD) (50.8%) followed by Vetiveria nigritana (46.4%), Cyperus papyrus (44.5%), Panicum repens (39.9%) and Acroceras macrum (39.7%) at (p ˂ 0.05). These results clearly shown that the some of the grass species of the Kafue flat have good nutrition content and therefore are a good source of nutrition for ruminants in the dry season",Agriculture Sciences,10/27/2023
"Cytopathology of Extragenital Transmissible Venereal Tumour in a Dog in Lusaka, Zambia",Girja Shanker Pandey; Careen Hankanga; Farai Phiri; Mercy Mfula Chipolo; Racheal Mwenda; Noanga Mebelo,"Transmissible Venereal Tumour (TVT), a round cell tumour probably originating from genetic alteration of canine histiocytes, is a horizontally and sexually transmitted disease that affects dogs and other canids. There is no published report on extragenital TVT among dogs in Zambia. The present case reports the cytopathology and haemato-biochemistry of an extragenital TVT, without primary genital involvement in a 4-year-old male dog in Lusaka, Zambia. There were a total of 18 cutaneous immobile nodules ranging in size from 25 to 57 mm on the dorsal and ventral aspects of the body, and no ulceration or bleeding was observed. Haemato-biochemistry revealed anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, hyperproteinaemia, increased blood creatinine and urea nitrogen. Based on cytology, TVT of the lymphoid subtype was diagnosed, ruling out suspicion of cutaneous lymphoma or histiocytoma. Definitive diagnosis was easily based on physical examination and cytological findings of typical TVT cells in exfoliated cells through FNAC, which is a rapid, reliable, efficient, cost-favourable and more conclusive hastening intervention than waiting for histopathology. Our findings emphasise the need to consider TVT on the differential diagnosis list for masses in extragenital sites in dogs from geographic regions where TVT is prevalent.",Veterinary Medicine,11/24/2023
Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and Household Food Security in High-Density Residential Areas of Lusaka: Experiences from Ng’ombe Settlement,Lizzy Michelo; Progress Nyanga; Banda Alick,"Comparable to the rest of the world, African countries are orbiting from the health, economic and social effects of COVID-19. The continent’s administrations responded to COVID-19 guidelines by imposing restrictions to limit the spread of the virus. COVID-19 and measures responses to the pandemic, undermine food production, processing and marketing, but the most concerning experiences are on the demand-side, economic and physical access to food. Food and Agriculture Organisation’s (FAO) ‘four pillars’ availability, accessibility, stability and utilisation provide a complete framework for analysing food security. However, the paper was looking at how people in high-density residential areas are experiencing food security during the COVID-19 period. The main aim was to assess the experiences of residents of high-density urban residential areas of Lusaka in terms of household food security before and during the COVID-19 pandemic era. The study used the convergent research design. Structured interviews were used to collect data from the respondents using questionnaires administered to a sample of 235 Ng’ombe residents. Key informants were selected purposively from Ng’ombe Urban Health Centre, Ng’ombe Catholic Church, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the Ministry of Agriculture and the World Food Programme (WFP) officials. Data was collected using semi-structured interviews with a tool called an interview guide. The data was analysed using descriptive statistics, paired t-test and chi-square using R statistical computing software and Excel. The results were presented using tables, pie charts and graphs. The study revealed that Ng’ombe residents had a devastating experience during the COVID-19 era, which included a reduction in income, hunger, job losses, skipped or reduced meal sizes and compromised diet. Also, pinpointing areas for governments and other actors to intervene in the food system to protect the food security of households left vulnerable by COVID-19, for example, empowering the affected households with money for businesses and job creation.",General,11/8/2023
"Fusarium Wilt Disease of Eggplant:  Farmers’ Socio-Demographic Characteristics, Farming History, Awareness and Perception in Major Eggplant Growing Areas of Ghana",Edmund Owusu; Charles Kwoseh; Enoch Osekre; Emmanuel Duku; Barnabas Adongo; Eric Gyasi,"Fusarium wilt disease causes losses to eggplants in many parts of Ghana. However, information about farmers’ appreciation and management of the disease is limited.In this study, farmers’ socio-demographic characteristics, farming history, awareness and perception of Fusarium wilt disease of eggplants in some major eggplant growing areas in the Ashanti, Eastern and Volta Regions of Ghana were determined. Purposive sampling was used to select major eggplant-producing communities, and the snowball technique was employed to identify eggplant farmers. A structured questionnaire aided with pictures of Fusarium-infected eggplant was used to inquire for information from 750 farmers in the three regions; 250 from each region and 50 from each of the 5 communities selected in each region. The farmers in the three regions had similar socio-demographic characteristics and knowledge of the Fusarium wilt disease of eggplants. Farmers were mostly within the age group of 30 years to 50 years, and 63% had formal education. Land preparation was mainly manual, except for some parts of the Volta region that used tractors. Mixed cropping with other vegetables and crop rotation with cereals was most practised. Farmer-selected seeds were the major planting materials. Wilt symptoms were a common observation of farmers in all the regions. However, the majority were oblivious of the cause and source of the disease and, therefore, were unable to apply appropriate management methods. 
Farmers could not estimate losses caused by Fusarium wilt disease and, therefore, were not keen on management methods.",Agriculture Sciences,11/23/2023
Effects of Different Levels of a Locally Made Probiotic (BiolatemTM ) Administered Through Drinking Water on Growth Performance of Broiler Chickens,Francisco Kanyinji; Harrison Lungu; Jonas Wiza Ng'ambi; Kolawale Odubute; Josep Simbaya; Oswin C Chibinga,"This    study    aimed    at    determining    the   growth   performance   of   broiler   chickens  offered  varying  amounts  of a locally made probiotic (Biolatem™) in  drinking  water.

Investigating Practices Predisposing Fish Farmers to Malaria Infection: An Analytical Cross Section Survey of Mongu and Limulunga Districts of Western Province of Zambia,Ellah Zingani; Lungowe M Nakweba,"Malaria is a parasitic disease transmitted between humans through the bite of the infected female Anopheles mosquito.    Zambia  has  recently  experienced a   growing   demand   for   fish,  which is  largely  triggered  by  the  growing  population   and   an   emergent   urban   middle  class  within  Zambia  and neighbouring  countries.  Various  fish farming     practices     are     conducted     on small-scale, smallholder and commercial levels. Western Province is among the provinces in Zambia where fish farming is done. In 2014, Zambia became   the   sixth   largest   producer   of  farmed  fish  (mainly  breams  –  a local  name  for  tilapia)  in  Africa  and  the  largest  in  the  Southern  African  Development  Community  (SADC) between  2012  and  2015.  From  2012  to  2015,  malaria  prevalence  started to  increase  from  12.6%  to  15.6% in  the  Western  Province  of  Zambia. This  study  set  out  to  investigate  the practices of fish farmers that predispose them  to  malaria  infection  in  Mongu and  Limulunga  districts  of  Western Province  of  Zambia. An  interviewer-administered  questionnaire  was  used  as  the  data  collection  tool. Data  was  analysed  using  Statistical  Package  for  Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22. Out of a total of 75 fish farmers, 83% of the participants had good knowledge of   malaria,   while   17%   had   poor   knowledge,  and  an  association  was  found between the two highest levels of education (Tertiary and Secondary) and  knowledge  of  malaria  according  to  the  chi-squared  test  (p",Biomedical Sciences,12/6/2023
Reproductive Performance of Semi-Intensively Managed Dairy Herd in Zambia,Kolawole Odubote; Mayoba Barbara Moono,"This  study  was  undertaken  to  provide  empirical  evidence for some reproductive performance traits in  a  dairy  herd  managed  under  a  semi-intensive  production system in Zambia. Milk production and calving records on 106 milking cows were analysed over  a  12-year  period  involving  Friesian,  Jersey,  Friesian x Jersey, Friesian x Simmental and Jersey x  Sussex  breeds.  With  an  average  parity  order  of  4.4, the average total milk production per lactation,  average daily milk production, calving interval, and calving  rate  were  1,996  ±  493.5Kg,    7.9  ±  2.6Kg,  473.1  ±  138.5  days,  and  77.2%  respectively.  Milk  production  was  significantly  higher  from  mid November  to  April  compared  to  other  months  and  this corresponds to the significant seasonal effect observed.  A  significant  breed  effect  was  found with  total  milk  yield  per  lactation  and  average  milk yield. There were significant parity effects on average daily milk production and calving interval. However, there was no significant breed effect on the calving interval. The correlation of average milk yield with calving interval was -0.26, and the parity order  with  average  milk  yield  was  0.65.  Friesian  x   Jersey   crossbred   showed   heterosis   for   milk   production  (48.3%)  and  calving  interval  (11.4%).  Breeding  strategies  can,  therefore,  be  targeted  at  using Jersey x Friesian crossbred for the emergent smallholder farmers",Agriculture Sciences,5/7/2024
The In vitro Biological Activity Testing of Vitex doniana Bark Extract and Virosa Root Extract Against Taenia Solium Metacestodes,Victoria Michelo Musale; Simbarashe Chitanga; Kabemba Evans Mwape,"Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm, is a foodborne parasite of global concern affecting more than 50 million people globally with more than 80% of these being in the developing world. Infection of the brain with larval stages (metacestodes) leads to neurocysticercosis, a leading cause of epilepsy in endemic areas of the world where pig rearing is common. People in pig rearing communities rely on local herbs for their primary health care. Exploring the use of these herbs as anthelminthics will give insights into the biological activity of locally available herbs and open up avenues for more research on local herbs. The objective of this study was to determine the in-vitro anthelminthic activity of locally used anti-parasitic herbs namely Vitex doniana bark extract and Flueggea virosa root extract against T. solium metacestodes.
An experimental in-vitro study using intact T. solium metacestodes with full bladder walls was conducted to check for cysticidal activity of the locally available herbs of V. doniana bark extract and F. virosa outer root cover extract. Non-evagination of metacestodes at incubation, post-treatment was used as indicator of activity of the extract against the metacestode. Treatment with praziquantel was used as a positive control. The herbs (V. doniana and F. virosa) and drug extracts (Praziqauntel) were tested in five different concentrations. 
Vitex doniana at concentration of 50µg/ml resulted in evagination of 64%, while F. virosa had 52% at the same concentration. Vitex doniana and F. virosa showed a dose dependent response, in that the higher the dose the higher the biological activity. This study showed an association between T. solium metacestodes response to V. doniana and praziquantel (Chi square = 29.63 versus tabulated value 3.84) indicating that there was an association between exposure of metacestodes to the treatment of V. doniana and Praziquantel. The same was observed with F. virosa and praziquantel (Chi square = 42.28).
Vitex doniana showed more biological activity than F. virosa, but both had at least biological activities above 50%.  This shows that both herbs have potential to be anthelmintics against T. solium metacestodes, and are recommended to be explored further in animal models for activity against the adult tapeworm.",Biomedical Sciences,6/6/2024
Risk Factors Associated with Mortality of Breast Cancer Patients After Surgery: The Case of Zambia,Justin Mulope; Banda Amos,"Breast   Cancer   (BC)   has   become   a   public   health   problem  worldwide  due  to  its  high  mortality  rate  among  women  in  both  developed  and  developing  countries.  The  association  between  BC  mortality  and  patient  care  and  personal  factors  has  been  widely  studied in developed countries. However, scarce data regarding  BC  mortality  and  its  prognostic  factors  is  available  in  Zambia.  This  research  aimed  to  identify  the factors affecting survival rates and to estimate a 5-year mortality of BC patients after surgery.
Retrospective data was collected from medical records of patients from the Cancer Diseases Hospital (CDH) in Lusaka, Zambia. The records encompassed 233 women who had undergone BC surgery between 2013 and 2018 and were followed up until the end of 2019. Prognostic factors of BC mortality after surgery using  a  Logistic  regression  model  were  determined.  The most commonly used statistic of comparison was the Odds Ratio (OR). Further, 5-year mortality rates for various age groups were estimated using the fitted model.
Age  at  surgery,  marital  status,  HIV  status, BMI,  BC  stage,  histologic  grade,  and  PR  status  were  significantly  associated  with  the  mortality  of  BC patients  after  surgery.  The  odds  of  death  increased  with the degree of severity across the levels of factors such as tumour size, lymph node status, BC stage and histologic  grade.  Also,  the  odds  ratio  for  mortality  increased   with   the   age   of   patients.   Additionally,   the odds of death were higher for HIV-positive and unmarried patients compared to the HIV-negative and married  ones.  Further,  the  odds  of  death  for  obese  or  overweight  patients  were  more  than  twice  that  of  those classified as not obese. Furthermore, the 5-year mortality of different age groups using multiple logistic regression stood at 75.4 per cent for the younger group (≤ 35 years) and 99 per cent for the older group (50",General,7/1/2024
Genetic Distance and Gene flow in Two Breeds of Nigerian Indigenous Goats Using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphic Marker,Adetunmbi Tella,"Goats  constitute  an  indispensable  part  of  the  rural  agricultural   systems   because   of   their   capacity   to   withstand  severe  weather,  potential  to  yield  milk  and  meat,  fast  generation  times.  Additionaly,  they  can  withstand  the  substandard  diets  that  are  provided  by  restricted  grazing  on  marginal  soils.  Gene  flow, genetic  distance,  genotype  frequencies,  and  alleles  were  investigated  using  two  native  goat  breeds  from  Nigeria. The investigational goat populations included Red Sokoto (50) and WAD (45). For each animal, an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) container was filled with approximately 5 milliliters of aseptic blood taken.  Polymorphism  of  restriction  fragment  length  and Agarose gel electrophoresis were carried out after the DNA samples were isolated and purified. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), gene allele frequency, anticipated  and  observed  heterozygousities  (He  and Ho,  respectively),  and  populations  were  compared based   on   their   genetic   distances.   The   degree   of   genetic diversity was great. According to the findings, Red Sokoto and WAD exhibited the highest genetic similarity  (0.9996)  and  the  lowest  genetic  distance  (0.0004) between the two populations. If more animals from  different  goat  breeds  are  collected,  improved genetic research and marker-assisted selections in goat improvement programmes would be achievable.",Veterinary Medicine,6/4/2024

Orisasami; Beatrice O Oyekan,"Honey  consists  of  a  variety  of  sugars,  minerals, vitamins,  enzymes,  proteins,  phenolic  mixtures,  and organic components, which define if it is genuine or contaminated.  As  a  result,  this  work  was  undertaken  to examine the nutritional and heavy metal properties of  honeys  sold  in  two  Nigerian  states  in  the  South  west.  Samples  of  honey  were  taken  from  twenty  hives   in   two   southwestern   states   and   tested   for   antimicrobial, physicochemical, proximate, and heavy metal   characteristics   using   standard   recommended   procedures,  while  heavy  metals  were  detected  with  an  Atomic  Absorption  Spectrophotometer.    Zones  of  inhibition at 100% w/v for the test organisms are 10 – 28 mm for E. coli, 13 – 26 mm for Salmonella, 17 – 27 mm  for  Staphylococcus  aureus,  and  11  –  25  mm  for  Klebsiella  with  S.  aureus  being  more  sensitive  to  the  honey samples. The range of pH for physicochemical is 2.51 – 3.87, Total Titratable Acidity 0.07 – 0.53 %, Acidity  1.20  –  6.77%, and the ranges for proximate analyses  are  1.09  –  1.59%  protein,  7.10  –  11.37%  moisture,  0.33  –  0.63%  Ash,  0.20  –  0.30%  fat,  83.71  –  91.11% carbohydrate, and 342.95 – 371.20 kcal/g energy. There was a significant correlation recorded between   protein,   moisture,   ash,   fat,   carbohydrate,   and  energy  contents  of  the  honey  samples.  All  the  honey samples were negative for lead, chromium, and cadmium.  Copper  was  the  only  metal  found,  having  concentration ranges of 5.0 to 25.0 mg/kg. Because the  majority  of  the  samples  fulfilled  the  Codex Alimentarius Standard for honey, they can be taken or used therapeutically",Biomedical Sciences,6/4/2024
Analysis of the Socio-Economic and Cultural Factors Affecting Malaria Prevention in Provinces with High Malaria Prevalence in Zambia,Ellah Zingani; Kosamu Chupa; Chimbala A Mweshi; Evelyn Gondwe,"Malaria,   which   is   endemic   in   all   the   provinces   of    Zambia,  remains  one  of    the    leading  causes  of    morbidity and mortality. Records of the high prevalence of malaria is evident in Northern, Eastern, Muchinga and  Luapula  provinces,  despite  the  implementation  of malaria control and prevention strategies aimed at interrupting  the  disease  transmission,  which  includes  the  use  of  treated  mosquito  nets,  indoor  residual  spraying,  presumptive,  and  treatment  therapy  among  others. These provinces' socio-cultural and economic factors  were  explored  to  ascertain  if  they  might  contribute  to  the  altered  effectiveness  of  malaria control  interventions  that  have  proved  successful  in  other provinces. This study analysed the socio-cultural and economic factors affecting malaria prevention in provinces  with  high  malaria  prevalence  in  Zambia.  A  descriptive  cross-sectional  study  was  conducted.  An    interviewer-administered    questionnaire    was    administered to selective households in the four study provinces.1,580  people  participated  in  the  study,  with  a  response  rate  of  98.8%.  684  were  male,  and  896  were  female.  Findings  suggest  practices  and  beliefs  concerning   socio-cultural   and   economic   factors   influence the success of malaria control interventions in  the  provinces.  Low  levels  of  education  and  lack  of  it,  directly  impacted  the  understanding  of  malaria  prevention,   transmission,   and   interventions.   Self-medication,  use  of  leftover  medicines,  and  seeking  treatment late were attributed to low-income levels in all the four provinces. Type of housing and occupation exposed  individuals  to  malaria  infection.  Tailoring  malaria preventive measures to the socio-cultural and economic practices of the provinces will help reduce malaria cases in the provinces",Biomedical Sciences,6/24/2024

Kabwali; Lysa Thendji; Bernard Mudenda Hang’ombe,"A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted to detect the presence of E. coli in unprotected water wells  of  Chaona  Community  in Mwachisompola  area, Chibombo   District   of   Zambia.   48   wells   drawn  from  four  villages  were  sampled  from  the  study   area.   Laboratory   processes   of   culturing,   isolation  and  identification  of E.  coli  confirmed the  occurrence  of  the  bacterium  in  well  water.  The identified E.  coli  was  subjected  to  antibiotic  resistance testing, and PCR was used to detect the resistant genes further. Of the 48 unprotected wells sampled,  38  (79%,  95%  CI:  77.3  –  80.7%)  were  found contaminated with E. coli. Meanwhile, 16/48 (33.3%;  CI:  31.4  –  35.2%)  samples  were  found  with an average CFU of between 1000 and 10,000, the  highest  range.  E.  coli  isolates  were  also  tested  for  Multi-Drug  Resistance  (MDR),  of  which  one  isolate indicated being resistant to eight antibiotics and another to five antibiotics presenting (5.88%; CI: 3.2 – 8.6%) for each. Meanwhile, seven isolates were  resistant  to  four  antibiotics  (41.2%;  CI:  35.5  – 46.9%), and eight isolates were resistant to three antibiotics (41.1%, CI: 35.4 – 46.9%). In addition, 30.9%  (17/55)  of  the  isolated  E.coli organisms  were found to be resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics primarily; Ampicillin, Streptomycin, Tetracycline, Cefotaxime, Nalidixic Acid, Norfloxacin, and Ciprofloxacin.

"Detection of IgG Antibodies Against T. gondii and Associated Risk Factors in Domestic and stray Cats in Lusaka, Zambia",Farai Phiri; Careen Hankanga; Ntombi Mudenda; Ngonda Saasa; Mukubesa Andrew Nalishuwa,"Toxoplasma gondii (T.  gondii)  is  a  nearly ever present organism  that  infects  humans,  wildlife, birds, domestic and food animals. T. gondii has been reported in pigs, chickens, sheep, goats, and cattle. However, only members of the cat family (Felidae) are the definitive host and shed the environmentally resistant oocyst form of the organism in their faeces. Transmission to humans usually occurs by ingesting cysts in undercooked meat and exposure to soil and water  which  is  contaminated  by  oocysts.  Feline infections  are  typically  subclinical;  congenitally infected kittens are the ones that are most likely to have  clinical  signs  of  infection,  but  previously clinically healthy adult cats may also be affected. Despite the disease’s significance in public health, very  few  studies  have  been  done  on T.  gondii in Zambia. This study was a cross-sectional survey to investigate  the  seroprevalence  and  risk  factors  of Toxoplasmosis. A  survey  was  carried  out  using  a questionnaire that was distributed to cat owners who attended  the  veterinary  clinics.  The  questionnaire had demographic data for the cats, questions related to  the  risk  factors  of  Toxoplasmosis  in  cats,  and practices surrounding the cat owners, like how they handle  cat  litter,  whether  their  cat  was  indoor  or outdoor,  contact  of  the  cat  with  other  cats,  and straying behaviour of their cat. A total of178 blood samples  were  collected  from  both  stray  and domestic  cats  in  this  study.  Of  the  178  samples tested for T.  gondii  IgG  antibodies, 88 were from domestic cats and 90 from stray cats. Thirty out of 178 samples were positive for antibodies, indicating an  overall  seroprevalence  of  16.85%.  Of  the  30 positive seropositive samples, 60% (18) came from domestic  cats  and  40%  (12)  from  stray  cats. The seroprevalence for domestic cats was found to be 20.4% and that of strays 13.3%. The two risk factors found   to   be   associated   with toxoplasma Seropositivity  were  sex  (p=0.007,  95%,  CI 0.071,0.976)   and   diet   (p=0.038,   95%,   CI 1.395,95.418) It was concluded that Toxoplasma gondii was widely spread in the study population. The presence of the antibodies indicated that at one point in their lives, these  cats  were  actively  infected  and  shedding oocysts in the environment, thereby posing a risk to humans and other species like sheep and chickens.",Veterinary Medicine,7/16/2024
Comparative Study of Growth and Survival of Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and Three Spotted Tilapia (Oreochromis andersonii) Overwintered in Concrete Ponds in Zambia.,Jonas Wiza Ng'ambi; Manase Sanida,"This study aims to provide information on the growth of tilapia in winter nurseries.  This will help alleviate the adverse effects of the cold season on aquaculture in Zambia. In this study, Oreochromis niloticus (T1) and Oreochromis   andersonii (T2), with   initial mean weights of 2.12 ± 1.03 and 2.20 ± 1.03g   respectively   were   used.   The   fingerlings were stocked in six concrete ponds (7 × 5 m) at 6 fish/m2 (180   fish/pond),  in   three replications, which resulted in a total of 1080experimental fish. After 12 weeks of culture, the average weight gain (AWG) was 24.37 ±3.67 g for O. niloticus and 20.49 for ± 1.50for O. andersonii. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in the final weights (FW), average weight gain (AWG), specific growth rate (SGR), and survival rates of the two species. However, the food conversion ratio (FCR) for O. niloticus of 1.07 ± 0.11was significantly better (P < 0.05) than for O.andersonii   of   1.62   ±   0.10.   The   findings showed that O. andersonii can exhibit similar attributes as O. niloticus in terms of growth and survival in semi-intensive culture and by the end of the cold season, both species were overwintered to weights suitable for grow-out   culture.   Overwintering   of   late   spawn tilapia   may   help   provide   ready-to-stock fingerlings at the onset of the fish growing season in Zambia",Agriculture Sciences,4/10/2025

Economic activities were severely affected by the pandemic especially the lockdown policy where transportation during the outbreak was restricted to reduce the spread of the virusin Nigeria. The effects of the pandemic on food and other agricultural sectors were evident as it interferes with supply chain, impaired production and distribution. Impacts of the pandemic on fisheries and fish marketing of Ogun State, Nigeria were assessed. One thousand and two (1,002)  fish  farmers  and  nine  hundred  and  sixty-two  (962)  fish  marketers  were  randomly examined and statistically analysed. Results showed that majority of the respondents believe in the existence of COVID-19 in Nigeria(82.7%) and worrisome of the pandemic as fish farmers can  contact  it.  No  significant  relationship  (p  >  0.05)  between  COVID-19  pandemic  and parameters  of  positive  and  negative  situations  of  fish  farmers/marketers.  There  were  no significant relationship recorded between the pandemic and high profits gained by the fish farmers/marketers as  well  as  increased  fish  marketing;  between  COVID-19  pandemic  and decrease  in  fish  and  fingerlings  production  and  supply;  between  COVID-19  pandemic  and increased cost of fish feed as well as availability of feed ingredients. Significant relationship (p <  0.05)  exists  between  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  fish  demand.  Conclusively,  COVID-19 lockdown has empirical negative impacts on fisheries and fish marketing such as increased in cost of fish feeds, non-availability of feed ingredients, and decrease in table fish, fingerlings production  and supply. Farmers’  enlightenment on  the  virus  existence  (being a  zoonotic disease) and safety of fisheries workers,along the supply chain should be a prioritized.",Agriculture Sciences,5/29/2025
Exploring Dietary Patterns and Nutrition Status of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients attending a Teaching Hospital in Zambia,Nixon Miyoba; Abidan Chansa; Namakando Liusha; Mwatikosela Tembo; Bubala Thandie Hamaimbo,"This study explored food consumption patterns based on the Zambian Food-Based Dietary Guidelines and assessed the nutritional status of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients attending a diabetic clinic at a teaching hospital in Zambia. A cross-sectional design with quantitative methods was employed for data collection, analysis, and presentation. The hospital was purposively selected as it is the only teaching hospital in the district. A total of 146 consecutively diagnosed T2DM patients were recruited during the study period. Data on the types and frequency of food consumption across the six food groups were collected using a researcher-administered questionnaire. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated using standard procedures for measuring height and weight. Blood glucose readings were extracted from patient records. Research tools were pre-tested on a separate group of T2DM patients not included in the main study.
Results showed that 87% of participants had received dietary counselling following their diagnosis. Nearly all participants (97.3%) had consumed foods from the cereals, starchy roots, and tubers group in the previous seven days. While a high proportion (87.7%) reported vegetable consumption during the recall period, the mean vegetable intake score was relatively low (2.00 ± 1.24 SD). Only a quarter (25.3%) reported fruit consumption, with a mean score of 0.32 ± 0.61 SD. Over one-third of participants (36.3%) were overweight, with women comprising the majority (39.3%). BMI was significantly associated with age and sex (p  0.05).
The findings suggest that while patients generally adhered to the Zambian Food-Based Dietary Guidelines by consuming foods from all six food groups, fruit and vegetable intake remained suboptimal. Additionally, the high prevalence of overweight and obesity highlights the need for targeted interventions to promote healthier dietary practices among T2DM patients.",Agriculture Sciences,6/19/2025
Potential of a Powdered Mopane Worms-Breakfast Meal Blend as a Nutritious Porridge for Children in Zambia,Yongo Salasini; Nixon Miyoba; Bubala Thandie Hamaimbo; Vincent Nyau,"In Zambia, the intake of animal-sourced proteins remains low in many households, despite their essential role in supporting physical growth, cognitive development in children, and overall health in adults. Among edible insects, Mopane worms are widely consumed and offer a protein content comparable to that of conventional meats. However, there is limited research on incorporating Mopane worms into cereal-based foods such as porridge to enhance their nutritional value, and little is known about the nutritional composition and consumer acceptability of such products. This study investigated the nutritional attributes and consumer acceptance of porridge made from two Mopane worm breakfast meal composite blends and one conventional breakfast meal. Mopane worms (variety Mumpa kaseke) were sourced from Muchinga Province and processed under clean, dry conditions. Two composite blends were formulated following World Food Programme super cereal guidelines: MB80 (80% breakfast meal and 20% Mopane worm powder) and MB75 (75% breakfast meal and 25% Mopane worm powder). The samples were analyzed in triplicate for proximate composition and mineral content (calcium, iron, and zinc) using AOAC (2005) methods. Consumer acceptability was also assessed for the three porridge types.
Results indicated that Mopane worm powder had a high protein content (55.60 ± 4.01%). The MB80 and MB75 composite blends contained 16.74 ± 1.98% and 19.04 ± 1.11% protein, respectively. MB75 had higher iron content (1.74 ± 0.74%) than MB80 (1.04 ± 0.19%), while MB80 had more zinc (0.57 ± 0.11%) than MB75 (0.41 ± 0.74%).

"Factors Influencing the Selection of Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine as a Preferred Programme of Study among the University of Zambia Veterinary Students, Zambia",Thresa Mwansa Mumba; Joyce Siwila,"Career selection is a very crucial and critical stage in one's life, it demands consideration of many factors. In the past making career choices was not difficult and dependent on family background, which could have led to job dissatisfaction. Making a career choice in veterinary medicine was more challenging because veterinary medicine was considered a masculine job and thus discriminated against women. However, veterinary medicine now offers multifaceted career prospects that cut across gender and race. This study was aimed at identifying factors that influenced enrolled veterinary students at the University of Zambia students in selecting the Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine (BVM) as the preferred program of study; and to asses the challenges faced by the students. This was a cross-sectional study conducted among veterinary students from 2nd to 6th (final) year students regardless of age or gender. A total of 145 students were enrolled and a semi-structured questionnaire was administered to each participant to collect demographic, socioeconomic and environmental factors hypothesized to influence selection of Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine as the program of choice. Data was summarised into proportions and presented in percentages. A total of 135 participants completed the questionnaire in full, with 51% of respondents being females. Several factors were observed to have influenced career choice among the veterinary students, however, majority (46%; 62/135) of students indicated that they were personally interested in the programme and loved working with animals. It was further noted that parents and friends were the main source of information regarding the BVM programme, indicating the need for the University to provide complete information to prospective students so that they can make informed decisions. Workload was the was the major challenge the students indicated in their pursuit of the degree. The study findings indicate the University of Zambia needs to device ways to communicate to prospective students to ensure that they have complete and current information on programmes on offer to avoid misinformation which is likely among peers and if coming from uniformed third parties. The findings also agree with literature indicating work overload as one of the challenges veterinary students face in their pursuit for the degree.",Veterinary Medicine,2/12/2025

"Malaria Transmitting Anophiline Mosquito Larva in Fishponds of Mongu District, Western Province of Zambia",Ellah Zingani; Conrad Muyamba Busiku; Monicah Mirai Mburu,"Mongu District, situated in the malaria-endemic Western Province of Zambia, has witnessed a significant increase in fish farming activities in recent years. These practices have brought substantial economic and nutritional benefits to the local population, offering an alternative source of income and food security. However, poorly managed fishponds have emerged as potential breeding grounds for Anopheles mosquitoes, the primary vectors responsible for malaria transmission. This poses a dual challenge of promoting sustainable aquaculture while mitigating associated public health risks.

This study aimed to investigate whether mosquito larvae found in fishponds within Mongu District belonged to malaria-transmitting Anopheline species. A total of 26 fishponds were surveyed across the district, with larvae samples collected, preserved, and subjected to detailed morphological identification at the Macha Research Trust. The findings revealed the presence of Anopheline mosquito larvae, which have the potential to mature into adult vectors of malaria. Crucially, unlined fishponds were identified as hotspots for mosquito breeding, whereas lined ponds were completely devoid of larvae. These observations underscore the role of proper fishpond design and management in reducing mosquito proliferation.
The study further highlights the effectiveness of lined ponds, which not only enhance water retention and fish productivity but also serve as a barrier against mosquito breeding. Additionally, the introduction of larvivorous fish species—fish that feed on mosquito larvae—was identified as a sustainable biological control measure to reduce malaria transmission risks associated with aquaculture.
These findings underscore the urgent need for integrated strategies that balance the economic benefits of fish farming with the imperative of malaria control. Recommendations include promoting the adoption of lined fishponds, training local farmers in best aquaculture practices, and encouraging the use of biological mosquito control methods such as larvivorous fish. Policymakers, public health officials, and aquaculture stakeholders must collaborate to ensure that fish farming contributes positively to livelihoods without exacerbating public health challenges.
This study serves as a critical reminder that the intersection of aquaculture and public health requires a coordinated approach to ensure sustainable development in malaria-endemic regions like Mongu District.",Biomedical Sciences,2/19/2025
Editorial: Increasing Human Mpox Cases: A Signal for Potential Re-emergence of Smallpox?,Samuel Munalula Munjita,"Since 2022, Mpox has surged to a global scale, with nearly 100,000 cases reported by June 2024. This resurgence predominantly affects individuals under 45, born during or after the cessation of smallpox vaccination. Epidemiological evidence confirms that smallpox vaccines offer over 80% protection against Mpox. The rise in Mpox cases appears to be driven by a cocktail of factors which include the emergence of new MPXV strains, a dwindling population of previously smallpox vaccinated individuals, and an increasing number of individuals unvaccinated against smallpox. Although those vaccinated over 40 years ago retain significant immunity, studies suggest a concerning annual decline of 1.29%. Given these dynamics - rising Mpox cases linked to declining head immunity against smallpox and a growing naïve population - the scenario raises a critical question: Are we on the brink of a smallpox re-emergence? However the question is answered, it is imperative to address these issues urgently by conducting large-scale investigations to understand the residual immunity against smallpox and refine vaccination strategies. The recent resurgence of measles highlights how swiftly diseases once under control can reappear when vaccination coverage declines.",Biomedical Sciences,4/11/2025

Due to their environmental persistence, microplastics degrade water quality, threaten aquatic biota, and pose potential health risks to humans through water/sea food consumption. Despite the global significance of this problem, no documented studies have assessed microplastic pollution in the Majidun River, Ikorodu, Lagos State, Nigeria. This study investigated the occurrence of microplastics in surface water and commercially available aquatic species in Majidun River, Ikorodu, Lagos State, Nigeria. Water samples were collected using amber bottles and analyzed for microplastic occurrence using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), while fish, Kribia kribensis, Chrysichthyes filamentous, Galeoides decadactylus, Clarias lazera, Carranx hippos and Monodactylus sebae) and crustacean species (Callinectes pallidus), were dissected to extract and analyze gastro-intestinal contents for microplastic contamination.The results revealed significant microplastic contamination in both the water and biota (fish and crab). Neoprene and Ethylene Propylene were the only polymers detected in the surface water. In the biota, eight microplastic polymers were identified: Polyacrylamide, Polyaramid, Nylon, Polybutylene terephthalate, polyvinyl alcohol, Ethylene propylene, Polyurethane, and Neoprene. Microplastic occurrence was highest in Monodactylus sebae (23%), followed by Galeoides decadactylus (19%), Clarias lazera (19%), and Carranx hippos (18%). The lowest occurrences were recorded in Kribia kribensis, Chrysichthyes filamentous, and Callinectes pallidus (7% each).

"Evaluation of Smallholder Dairy Farmers’ Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices and Factors Contributing to Hygienic Production of Raw Milk in Malawi’s Blantyre Agriculture Development Division",Enock Chilambula; John Kothowa; Save Kumwenda; Andrew Malata Phiri,"Dairy products provide nutrition to households but, could also serve as a source of many milk-borne  diseases  when  produced  under  poor  hygiene  conditions.  This  quantitative,  cross-sectional study administered 410 questionnaires, collected 90 raw milk samples and visited 90 farms  to  evaluate  hygienic  milk  production  practices  in  Malawi’s  Blantyre  Agriculture Development Division (BLADD). Descriptive statistics were used to summarise questionnaire, farm and laboratory observations data.The majority of farmers 86% and 66.6% (n=410) had formal  education  and  structured  pre-training in hygienic milk production respectively. The overall  KAP  knowledge  was  only  54%,  most  smallholder  dairy  farmers  reported  positive attitudes  at  88%  and  excellent  practices  at  63%.  Few  farmers  (27.1%;  n=410)  had  low aggregate  score  of  knowledge,  attitude  and  practice  were  six  (OR=5.910,  95%  CI:  1.997-17.489) times less likely to produce hygienic milk. Inadequate pre-training and a low aggregate score were identified as key factors behind the failure of smallholder farmers in Malawi’s BLADD  to  meet  Malawian  and  European  Union  (EU)  standards,  raising  concerns  about potential milk-borne diseases. Out of 90 raw milk samples analyzed for presence of E. coli, 11 (12%)  and  50  (55.5%)  raw  milk  samples  were  within  acceptable  limits  of  Malawian  and European Union standards respectively. These low percentages obtained could be attributed to  unsanitary  animal  quarters,  as  half  of  smallholder  dairy  farmers  in  Malawi’s  Blantyre Agriculture Development Division do not remove waste daily and some workers milk cows without supervision. In conclusion, smallholder dairy farmers had positive attitudes and good milk hygiene practices without grounded knowledge and it was difficult to meet legal limits of Malawi and European Union Standards for E. coli. Therefore, regular ongoing annual refresher farm management trainings and monitoring of hazards in raw milk production are important for safe milk",Biomedical Sciences,5/25/2025
Characterization of Qualitative and Quantitative Traits of Five Strains of Zambia Indigenous Chicken,Mayoba Barbara Moono; Wilson N.M Mwenya; Kolawole Odubote; Mubanga Mwale,"This study assessed the phenotypic characteristics of five indigenous chicken strains from Zambia’s Luapula, Northern, Muchinga, Southern, and Lusaka provinces, providing baseline data for a selective breeding program aimed at improving performance. A total of 100 chickens (74 females and 26 males) were sampled. Qualitative traits were observed, and quantitative traits such as body weight, body length, thigh length and circumference, chest circumference, shank length and circumference, wingspan, and keel length were measured. Males had significantly higher live body weights and measurements than females (P < 0.05), with average mature male weight at 1.88 kg and females at 1.63 kg. Frizzled-feathered males had significantly higher shank lengths (10.8 ± 0.76 cm) than females. No significant strain differences among males were noted in wingspan or live weight. Naked-neck males had the highest live weight, while short-legged males had the lowest for all the strains. Normal-feathered, Naked-neck and Frizzled females had similar shank lengths and circumferences, significantly higher than dwarf females. The study found high positive correlations between body weight and other measurements (P < 0.01), except for body length and thigh length circumference in naked-neck females. Chickens were distributed as normal-feathered (44%), white-spotted (19%), naked-neck (17%), short-legged (13%), and frizzled-feathered (7%). The dominant comb type was single (96%), followed by pea (3%), and rose (1%). Grey shank colour was most common (33%), followed by white (31%), black (18%), and yellow (17%), with green at 1%. White earlobe colour was universal (100%), and eye colours were predominantly brown (42%), followed by black (31%) and grey (23%), with white and grey being the least common (1% and 3%). The phenotypic diversity within these strains suggests great potential for improving indigenous chicken performance through selective breeding.",Agriculture Sciences,4/10/2025
"Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia-Associated Fetal Wastage and Meat Quality Compromise in Cattle Slaughtered  at Dr Abubakar Saraki Memorial Abattoir, Kwara State, Nigeria",Isaac Dayo Olorunshola; Shukrah Omotayo Ghal; Andrew Raymond Peters; David Sunday Adegboye,"Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is still endemic in Nigeria. The Mycoplasma Unit of the Department of Veterinary Microbiology, University of Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria, has completed an 18-month investigation of CBPP cases encountered at the main city abattoir. Investigation was with special emphasis on fetal wastes, physical and health conditions of cattle presented for slaughter at the abattoir. Blood and tissues samples were obtained during ante mortem and postmortem examinations for laboratory investigations and diagnosis of CBPP were based on classical pathological lesions and culture of Mycoplasma organism identified serologically as M. mycoides subsp. mycoides from lung lesions and pleural fluids obtained from the cattle. From a total of 41,069 cattle slaughtered, 40,075 (97.6%) were cows from which 6,699 fetuses were encountered, and 963 (2.3%) were bulls. Thus, an average of 372 fetuses was wastedeach month at the abattoir. Of the 40,075 cows slaughtered, 913 (2.3%) were CBPP-positive and carried 153 fetuses. Most cows carried twin fetuses.We estimate that each fetal wastage is equivalent to 50,000 Naira losses to the farmer, and each emaciated animal slaughtered is a loss of approximately 200,000 Naira.Studies are warranted to determine annual national economic losses resulting from slaughtering emaciated cattle that are often discovered to be pregnant, and propose strategies to address the avoidable revenue loss.",Veterinary Medicine,6/26/2025
Evaluating the Effects of Garlic (Allium sativum) as a Feed Additive on the Growth Performance and Immune Response in Broiler Chickens,Joyce Mufungwe; Mayoba Barbara Moono; Ignatius Musenge Chimbaka; Francisco Kanyinji; Idowu Kolawole Odubote; Sylvia Jana Harrison; Joseph Nkhuwa,"In a quest to find affordable, antibiotics free and readily available means of increasing broiler meat productivity, a number of natural feed additives have been tested and suggested. Garlic (Allium sativum) has emerged as a preferable alternative to synthetic feed additives. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of garlic as a feed additive on feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion ratio, and immune response. 300-day-old chicks were acclimatized for 2 weeks and then randomly assigned to 5 treatments (0.00%, 0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75%, and 1.00% garlic inclusion levels) with replicates. Mean weekly feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion ratio, and differential leucocyte counts (lymphocytes, heterophils, basophils, eosinophils, and monocytes) were analyzed for treatment effects. There were significant differences among the means across all treatments for all dependent variables except mean weekly body weight gain at 2 weeks. Garlic supplementation significantly influenced body weight from three to six weeks of age, with the control group (0.00%) consistently exhibiting the lowest body weight. At six weeks, body weight was highest at 0.75%, followed by 1.00%, 0.50%, and 0.25% garlic inclusion levels, demonstrating the positive impact of dietary garlic on growth performance. It was also observed that garlic supplementation led to increases in the basophil and monocyte counts, suggesting a bolstered immune system.",Agriculture Sciences,4/10/2025
A Comparative Study of Pharmaceutical and Bio-Equivalence Characteristics of Different Brands of Extended-Release Diclofenac Sodium Marketed in Zambia Using the Mongoloid Dog Model,Safe Maricky Musonda; Tyson Longwani Muungo,"Diclofenac sodium is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound (NSAID) that is used to treat inflammation and manage pain caused by various conditions. In Zambia, numerous generic brands of diclofenac are available on the market, providing prescribers and patients with a wide range of options. This Study compared pharmaceutical and bioequivalence characteristics of three (3) different brands of extended-release diclofenac sodium 100mg tablets marketed in Zambia. An analytical technique was employed to examine physicochemical parameters. The dissolution analysis was conducted using the paddle technique. A randomised, single-dose, two-way crossover design was performed on six Mongoloid female dogs that were fasted. After receiving 100 mg diclofenac sodium tablets orally, the levels of diclofenac in the plasma were determined using UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including the time taken for maximum drug concentration (T-max), maximum drug concentration in plasma after dosing (C-max), area under the curve from 0 to 10 (AUC 0-10), and area under the curve infinity (AUC ∞), were determined through a non-compartmental procedure. The physicochemical characteristics were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA), while Bioequivalence was assessed using the linear-log trapezoidal rule method. 
The non-aqueous titration showed that the purity of diclofenac ranged from 95.41% to 102.8% w/w. All brands were well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, and the parameters were within the acceptable range set by the FDA for Bioequivalence. The 100 mg diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets from three brands had good physical and chemical properties and met the criteria for drug release. However, there were noticeable differences in the AUC0-10hrs between brand A and brands B and C, suggesting that while the brands are chemically similar, they are not equal in terms of biological equivalence.",Biomedical Sciences,6/2/2025
A case of 4-year-old Female sheep-Goat Hybrid Born Under Natural Conditions in Namibia,Matias Natangwe Naunyango; Cindy K Harper; Girja Shanker Pandey,"This article reports a 4 year old female sheep x goat interspecific hybrid born under natural conditions in Namibia. Repetitive DNA sequencing using microsatellite markers was used to confirm the hybrid. Morphological characteristics of the sheep-goat hybrid had higher parameters in terms of heart girth, height at withers and trunk length compared to other animals in the flock. The weight of hybrid was 74 kg while the weight of its dam, a goat doe, was 42 kg and the possible sire, a sheep ram, weighed 51 kg.  The hybrid had long and thick tail, a head resembling a sheep whereas its skin, horns, and teats were like those of a goat and its legs were relatively long. The hybrid conceived on two occasions with a buck, but aborted at about 4 months into the pregnancy. The hybrid in terms of body weight and dimensions was bigger than common goats and sheep found in the rural livestock traditional farming area of the region possibly indicating hybrid vigour. The hybrid’s large size brings hope about need of more research and breeding and the possibility towards cloning of such animals using nuclear transfer technology for increased meat production in future. The authors believe this is the first documented report of a sheep-goat hybrid from Namibia, and third in Africa, that lived normally for a long time to full adulthood and even conceived, even though the conceptus was aborted.",Veterinary Medicine,5/14/2025

This study investigates the antimicrobial activity and phytochemical composition of Combretum molle, a native Zambian plant, to explore its potential as a cost-effective source for novel antimicrobial agents. Exhaustive extraction using solvents of varying polarities was performed on dried leaf extracts of C. molle. These extracts were tested against a panel of clinically significant gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and screened for phytochemicals. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of steroids, terpenoids, phenols, flavonoids, tannins, saponins, alkaloids, and glycosides. Antimicrobial activity was assessed using disk diffusion and broth microdilution techniques, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined through spectrophotometry and spot inoculation. The results revealed substantial antimicrobial activity, with hexane extracts showing the highest efficacy (MIC range: 3.6 to 50.4 mg/ml) and ethanol extracts exhibiting comparable activity to tetracycline (inhibition zones: 6 to 26 mm, P-value < 0.05). These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of C. molle extracts and support their possible integration into ethnomedicine as alternatives to conventional antimicrobials. By tapping into nature's arsenal, this study contributes to the search for effective strategies against multi-drug resistance, offering hope in the fight against AMR.",Biomedical Sciences,5/19/2025
Performance of Cowpea Progenitor and Hybrids in Varying Concentration Levels of Phosphorus in Hydroponic Setup.,Emmanuel Chikalipa,"Among abiotic factors limiting cowpea productivity, phosphorus (P) is an important element. However, in Zambia, no study has determined optimal soil P concentrations for the available cowpea germplasm. The objectives of this study were (i) to identify cowpea genotype that performs better in different concentration levels of phosphorus in hydroponic setups,  and ii) to determine the phenotypic response of agronomic variables in different concentration levels of phosphorus. The experiment was set up as 4 x 10 completely randomized design (CRD) replicated 3 times, with 4 doses of P, thus, 0mg/L, 4.7mg/L, 9.3mg/L and 13.95mg/L in nutrient medium and ten genotypes (G). Genotype LT BT1h was identified as a better performer across P concentration. Further exploration of G x P interaction main effects revealed that genotype LT BT1 h performed better than the progenitor in all doses of P concentration except in a medium with 9.3mg/L and 13.95mg/L. Overall, the results showed that applying a concentration above 9.3mg/L P impeded seedling productivity. Significant better performances were obtained with shoot biomass, plant biomass and shoot length of measured variables, implying that the identified variables in varying levels of P concentration can initially be used to aid in selecting for high performing genotypes. The identified novel and best-performing cowpea hybrids for economic traits be recommended for further evaluation.",Agriculture Sciences,6/7/2025
Sweet but Toxic: Organophosphate Pesticide Residues in Nigerian Honey as an Emerging Threat to Food Safety and Agriculture,Olufela Ogunbo; Abdulwahab Osibogun; Folarin Ojo Owagboriaye; Marvellous Ariyibi; Abduljeleel Jimoh Adeyemi; Bamidele Julius; Sulaimon Aina; Olusegun Adebayo Lawal,"Honey, despite its nutritional and therapeutic properties, can pose significant risks to environmental health and food safety due to the presence of contaminants. This study investigated the occurrence of organophosphate pesticide residues in honey samples collected from hard-to-reach apiaries in Nigeria and examined the relationship between these residues, honey purity, and nutritional composition. Multiple organophosphate residues were detected using Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry, with dimethoate and merphor being the most prevalent. Although all detected concentrations were below the maximum residue limits (MRLs) set by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), some values, particularly dimethoate from Imosan, approached the regulatory thresholds. Nutritional analysis revealed that the protein, moisture, ash, and sugar contents of the honey samples generally fell within international quality standards. Statistical correlations indicated strong associations between honey purity and pesticide residues, as well as with moisture and dry matter content. This study underscores the need for continuous monitoring of pesticide residues in apicultural products and highlights potential implications for food safety and public health.",General,5/29/2025
Optimization of the production process and nutritional composition of Zambian Munkoyo and Chibwantu Non-Alcoholic Beverages,Grace Kabombo Munthali; John Shindano; Syney Phiri; Himoonga Bernard Moonga,"This study investigated the optimization of production procedures and nutritional content of Munkoyo and Chibwantu, traditional Zambian non-alcoholic beverages. Key production parameters, such as, pH, Total Titratable Acidity, viscosity, and Total Soluble Solids were evaluated for optimization, while analyses for proximate composition, calcium, iron, and zinc were conducted to assess nutrient content. Results revealed no significant differences in fermentation outcomes between extracts from 100 g and 150 g of dried Munkoyo root (p > 0.05), with pH levels ranging from 3.53 to 3.77 and TTA below 1%. Nutritional analyses indicated that Munkoyo contains 2.7 to 4.1 mg/100 g of calcium, 0.04 to 0.05 mg/100 g of iron, and 0.19 to 0.38 mg/100 g of zinc, while Chibwantu provides 2.4 to 4.7 mg/100 g of calcium, 0.03 to 0.05 mg/100 g of iron, and 0.25 to 0.46 mg/100 g of zinc. The low mineral content suggests supplementation with nutrient-rich ingredients.

"A Case Report of Argulosis at a Recreational Fishing Dam in Lusaka, Zambia",Zainul Abedeen Bhura; Sipiwe Ndhlovu; John Chilundu; Racheal Mulauzi; Kunda Ndashe,"This study reports the first confirmed outbreak of argulosis in Zambia, involving multiple fish species at a recreational fishing dam in Lusaka. Argulus spp. (fish lice), ectoparasitic crustaceans known for their broad host range and pathogenicity, were identified as the causative agents. Six fish species, both indigenous and introduced, exhibited clinical signs such as erratic swimming and surface rubbing, with post-mortem examinations revealing characteristic lesions including skin ulcers and parasite-laden gills. Morphological analysis confirmed the presence of Argulus spp. Environmental stressors, high fish stocking densities, and unregulated fish transfers were identified as potential drivers of the outbreak. The findings highlight the growing risk of parasite emergence in managed aquatic systems across sub-Saharan Africa. Recommendations include enhancing biosecurity, routine surveillance, rapid response protocols, public awareness, and targeted research to mitigate future outbreaks and safeguard fish health and biodiversity.",Veterinary Medicine,5/27/2025
Programmed Death Ligand-1 Expression in Gastric Cancer Cases in Zambia,"Husna Munshi; 2.	Mupeta Songwe; Violet Kayamba; Violet Kayamba","Gastric cancer is a highly fatal disease in Zambia due to delayed diagnosis, aggressiveness of the disease and ineffective treatment. Programmed death ligand-1 is a key biomarker of gastric cancer, linked to immune evasion and response to anti- Programmed death ligand-1 therapies. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of in gastric cancer cases and its association with various clinicopathological prognostic factors in Zambia.
This pilot study utilized archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from patients diagnosed with gastric cancer at the University Teaching Hospitals in Lusaka, Zambia. A total of 41 gastric cancer samples were examined, with 65.9% female (27) and 34.1% male (14), and a median age of 63 years (interquatile range: 56–76). The slides were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin, followed by immunohistochemical analysis to assess Programmed Death Ligand-1 expression, which was evaluated using a combined positive scoring system. Statistical analysis was conducted using STATA, version 15.
Six patients (14.6%) exhibited positive expression of Programmed Death Ligand-1, with a combined positive score of 1 or higher. However, our analysis did not reveal any significant associations between PD-L1 expression and any of the clinicopathological variables assessed.

Prevalence and Factors Associated with Schistosomiasis in Ng'ombe Township of Lusaka Urban District.,Ng'andwe Kalungwana; David Mwakazanga; James Mwansa; Mable Mwale Mutengo; Seter Siziya,"Background:The transmission cycle of schistosomiasis requires contamination of surface water by excreta, specific freshwater snails as intermediate hosts, and human water contact. The disease is a rural problem, but urban foci can be found in many endemic areas.  The Zambian Ministry of Health (MOH) reports that schistosomiasis is highly prevalent in rural districts especially those close to the Lakes and rivers. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Ng'ombe Township is the hardest hit by schistosomiasis in Lusaka province of Zambia. Though a number of studies including national surveys have been done on schistosomiasis, no study on the factors associated with the disease in Ng'ombe Township has been documented.
Materials and Methods: A Cross Sectional Exploratory survey was conducted to determine the prevalence and factors associated with schistosomiasis in five schools of Ng'ombe Township in Lusaka district where a total of 260 school-going children aged 8-14 years, attending grade three (3) to grade five (5) participated in the study. 
Results: No cases of S. mansoni were recorded in the five schools of Ng'ombe Township.However, the overall prevalence of S. haematobium infection was 13.1% (34/260). Age was significantly associated with infection. Compared with participants of age less than 10 years, participants aged 10-11 years and those aged 12 years or older were 5.17 (95% CI [1.62, 16.49]) and 14.96 (95% CI [2.52, 88.65]) times more likely to get infected, respectively. Children in grade five were 65% (AOR=0.35, 95% CI [0.02, 0.40]) less likely to have Schistosomiasis than those in grade three. Pupils whose source of water at school was a public water tap were 73% (AOR=0.27, 95% CI [0.09, 0.90]) less likely to have schistosomiasis than those that were using a communal hand pump at school.

Prevalence of Helminths of Importance for Human Health in Stray Dogs in Lusaka Zambia.,"Eugene C Bwalya; Nalubamba, King S; Namangala, B","Stray dogs destined for euthanasia were collected from January 2010 through December 2010 to determine the presence of zoonotic gastrointestinal (GI) helminths in Lusaka district. A total of 33 stray dogs (male=18, female=15) were collected, euthanized and necropsy information obtained via helminthological approach. 100% (33/33) were infected with one or more helminth parasites. Multiple infections involving nematodes and cestodes were the most prevalent (63.6%), followed by nematodes only (33.3%) with cestodes only being the least prevalent (3.0%). The most prevalent GI helminth parasite was Ancylostomacaninum(93.9%) with the least prevalent being Toxocaracanis(6.1%). No positive case of Trichinella spiraliswas reported from direct trichinoscopy examination of striated muscles. The mean count per dog of A. caninumwas 44.45 (SD ±58.0) with a range of 0 to 223. The presence of three important zoonotic gastrointestinal helminths (A. caninum,T. canisand Dipylidiumcaninum) reported in this study underscores the importance of controlling helminthosis in stray dogs and stresses the need to establish a national control programme for parasitic diseases in this dog population.This can be achieved through vigorous implementation of the laws governing control of stray dogs and regular deworming of owned dogs. Controlling zoonotic helminths in dogs will ensure a minimal public health risk from the dog population in Zambia since they act as a source of infection to other dogs as well as humans",Veterinary Medicine,3/31/2012
Factors Affecting the Efficiency of Smallholder Cotton Producers in Zambia,Stephen Kabwe; Gelson Tembo; Thomson Kalinda,"Agriculture in Sub-Sahara Africa is considered as an engine of economic growth and has the potential to reduce rural poverty of smallholder farmers through increased food security and household income. However, most of Sub-Sahara Africa countries are faced with low agricultural productivity and this has undermined the potential to reduce rural poverty. The study focused on smallholder cotton producers in Zambia. Cotton is grown in Central, Eastern and Southern Provinces of Zambia and is an important cash crop which contributes over $60 million to the economy. It also supports over 150,000 households. However, productivity of smallholder cotton farmers in Zambia is low, around 800 kg per hectare or less. While in West Africa productivity is over 1000 kg per hectare. Agricultural productivity is defined as a measure of value of output for a given level of inputs. Efficiency is defined as the actual productivity of a farm relative to a maximal potential productivity. This shows that efficiency is related to productivity though it is productivity at maximum or minimum values. The study used the 2008 supplemental survey data collected by the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Central Statistics and Food Security Research Project. Using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) this study determines the technical, allocative and economic efficiency indices of a sample of 812 (population estimates 150,801) cotton producers in Zambia. Using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, the study determines the factors influencing technical, allocative and economic efficiency variations.  Results show that the mean technical, allocative and economic efficiency indices in cotton production are 46%, 37% and 20% respectively. This means that Zambian cotton farmers could reduce input use and production cost without altering the output by improving technical and allocative efficiency by 54% and 63% respectively. Female headed households, number of years spent in school by the household head, leaving crop residues, value of productive assets and off farm income are some of the factors found to positively influence the technical, allocative and economic efficiency. The study found that cotton farmers are relatively inefficient and there is room to improve efficiency among smallholder cotton farmers in Zambia. Some socio-economic and farm specific factors have a positive influence on efficiency. The study recommends that cotton stakeholders should devise strategies of involving more women in cotton production, improve access to productive assets, and encourage adoption of conservation farming crop residue retention as the means to improve cotton production efficiency.",Agriculture Sciences,3/31/2012
Climate Variability Impact on Livelihood Strategies Among Agro-Pastoralists in Southern Province of Zambia,Oswin Chibinga; Mashon Musimba; Moses Nyangito; Joseph Simbaya; Daura Moses,"The study was carried out in Choma District during the period of March to December 2010 to investigate the effect of climate variability and extreme weather conditions on livelihood coping practices among the agro-pastoralists. Climate data of the study area of a period of fifty years was used. Data on change in livelihood strategies were collected through the use of semi-structured questionnaires and observation. Sixty (60) households from 10 villages were selected for the study.
Climate data revealed that there has been an increase of 1.0-degree Celcius in the average annual temperatures over the previous five decades. The rainfall data revealed that there has been an increase in variability in the amount of annual rainfall received. However, there was a general decline in average annual rainfall received over the same period. The major livelihood adaptable practices for the pastoralists in times of extreme weather conditions are livestock sales and engaging in non-agricultural activities. Harvest of products from the forest such as charcoal burning, sale of firewood, carpentry and carving, as well as the sale of thatching grass was the most important non-agricultural livelihood strategy (50.13%), followed by trading 30.51%. The least practiced activities were a collection of wild fruits and fishing 1.69%. This means that with increased climate variability there will be more pressure on the forest and forest products. This could lead to deforestation.
Farmers have an understanding of climatic change and are engaged in various livelihood strategies to adapt to this
change in the environment. The farmers should be encouraged to engage in sustainable adaptable livelihood strategies for
survival. Harvesting of forest products during extreme weather conditions should be coupled with the replanting of these
indigenous trees to avoid depletion of the forest and further environmental degradation.",Agriculture Sciences,3/31/2012

Surveillance of Avian influenza Viruses in Wild Ducks and Geese in the Bangweulu Wetlands of Zambia,Bruno S.J. Phiri; Aaron S Mweene; John B. Muma; Ladslav Moonga; Bernard M. Hang'ombe,"Avian influenza is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease of avian origin and is of major economic and public health importance. Out of all the 16 haemagglutinin subtypes of influenza viruses, only H5 and H7 are considered highly pathogenic in poultry. However, previous studies have reported that serotype H9N2 produces severe respiratory and reproductive tract infections in chickens. Previous studies have suggested that poultry movement through trade and migratory wild birds play a major role in the spread of avian influenza viruses over long distances. Surveillance studies among wild ducks and geese in many parts of the world has always resulted in isolation of a broad spectrum of avian influenza virus subtypes. Although avian influenza has not yet been reported in Zambia, its outbreak would be devastating to the local economy. The present study was carried out to determine the presence of avian influenza viruses in the wild migratory ducks and geese on the Bangweulu wetlands of Zambia located in Luapula and Northern provinces of Zambia during 2009-2010. A total of 2,000 environmental samples of fresh faeces of wild ducks and geese on the Bangweulu wetlands of Zambia were examined and analysed for the presence of avian influenza viruses. The study found that H6N2 and H9N2 subtypes were present in the faeces of the Knob-billed ducks (Sarkidiornis melanotos). These data indicated that wild migratory ducks that inhabit the Bangweulu wetlands play a role as carriers of influenza viruses, thus necessitating continued surveillance studies so as to elucidate the ecology of the viruses in the area",Veterinary Medicine,3/31/2012
"Neonatal Apgar Score Outcomes in Spinal Versus General Anaesthesia at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH), Lusaka.",Carol Musonda Muloshi,"Background: The knowledge gap was from the fact that the type of anaesthetic drug administered during caesarean section can have effects on neonatal outcome like low Apgar score with most hospitals in developed countries now using more modern inhalational anaesthetic agents with fewer or no cardio-respiratory depressant effects e.g. Isoflurane or Sevoflurane. However at UTH, halothane is still being used for maintenance of general anaesthesia despite well documented cardio-respiratory depressant effects with very limited research done on its effects on neonatal Apgar score. The Apgar score is a means of rapid evaluation of the physical condition of infants shortly after birth. Thus this study investigated the effects of general anaesthesia with halothane versus spinal anaesthesia on neonatal Apgar score.
Objective and study design: With the view of determining the type of anaesthesia administered during caesarean section with the least effects on neonatal wellbeing shortly after birth, a prospective observational cohort study was conducted at the University Teaching Hospital between May 2015 and January 2016.The scientific objective was to determine the effects of general anaesthesia with halothane versus spinal anaesthesia on neonatal Apgar score. This study involved 70 neonates, 54 were born from mothers that had undergone caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia and 16 from mothers that had undergone general anaesthesia.
The data was analysed using SPSS version 16.0. Inferential analysis was conducted using logistic regression.
Results: 20 neonates out of 54 (37%) in the spinal anaesthetic group had an Apgar score less than 8 at 1 minute[Fig 1]. Out of the 16 neonates in the general anaesthesia group, 14 (87.5%) had Apgar score less than 8 at 1 minute[Fig 1]. One (1.9%) neonate had an Apgar score less than 8 at 5 minutes in the spinal anaesthesia group. While 4 (25%) neonates had Apgar score less than 8 in the GA group[Fig2]
The logistic regression at 1 minute Showed that it is over 11 times more likely to get a low Apgar with a general anaesthetic as compared to a spinal anaesthetic (OR 11.9), [Table 3].
The Apgar score at 1 minute in the Spinal anaesthesia group was statistically significantly higher than the general anaesthesia group (p=0.002). The logistic regression at 5 minutes Showed that it is over 17 times more likely to get a low Apgar with a general anaesthetic as compared to a spinal anaesthetic (OR 17.7), [Table 4]. Further, the 5 minutes Apgar score in the spinal anaesthesia group was statistically significantly higher than the general anaesthesia group (p=0.014),[Table 4].
Conclusion: With the results pointing to the fact that there is significant difference in neonatal Apgar score outcomes in spinal versus general anaesthesia, the researcher therefore rejected the null hypothesis. It is therefore inferred that spinal anaesthesia method has better neonatal outcomes by Apgar score measure than general anaesthesia method.",Biomedical Sciences,1/28/2021
Doubling National Efforts to Control and Eliminate Malaria in Zambia,James Chipeta; Mable Mwale Mutengo; Mulakwa Kamuliwo,"In 2009, Zambia received accolades of praise from the World Health Organization (WHO) for demonstrating 66% decline in malaria deaths and there was a clear indication, then, that the country had reached the 2010 Roll Back Malaria target of a more than 50% reduction in malaria mortality compared to the 2000 baselines of malaria morbidity and mortality (1,2). As a result of this achievement, during that year's World Malaria Day commemoration held on 25 April 2009, Zambia's efforts and achievement were celebrated and promoted as a model for other countries to follow. This remarkable achievement was attributed to the country's multi-front approach to control and case management of malaria involving mass use of long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets (LLITNs), scale-up of indoor residue spraying (IRS) and effective case management of malaria by the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. However, barely four years down the line, these achievements seem to be slipping away. What has gone wrong? Can this seeming slump in national malaria control activities be corrected and if so how? This editorial of the current issue of JABS attempts to address these vexing questions by giving a snap review of the national and world-wide scored successes in malaria control activities, lessons learnt and thereby charting an evidence-based way forward.",Biomedical Sciences,3/31/2014
"Effects of Bacillus Thuringiensis Var., Israelensis and Bacillus Sphaericus Mosquito Biolarvicides on Incidences of Malaria in Selected Areas of Lusaka Urban District, Zambia",A Kandyata; K J Mbata; C J Shinondo; C Katongo; R Kamuliwo; F Nyirenda; E Chanda,"Effects of spraying the mosquito biolarvicides Bacillus thuringiensisvar. israelensis(Bti) and Bacillus sphaericus(Bs) over freshwater bodies in four selected areas of Lusaka urban district, on incidences of malaria in the areas were investigated. Incidences of malaria prior to and after larviciding of the study areas were determined by reviewing and analyzing health centre records of laboratory confirmed positive malaria cases in the study areas prior to and after larviciding. There were relatively higher incidences of malaria cases in all study areas prior to larviciding. Malaria cases dropped drastically by 53-72 % immediately after larviciding in all study areas. However, though numerically very small percent-wise, there were observed marked rises in incidences of positive diagnosed malaria cases in Chelstone study area by the second month. Three study areas; Chainda, Mtendere and Ng'ombe showed continued decline or had slight rises in the incidences of malaria two months after larviciding. Possible reasons for the observed slight rises in incidence in the areas were; importation of malaria by travelers from outside the Lusaka urban district. The deployment of Bti and Bs larvicides in the context of integrated vector management is likely to have long term impacts on incidences of malaria in Zambia.",Biomedical Sciences,3/31/2014
"Anaesthetic Related Peri-Operative Complications During Caesarean Delivery at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia",Collins Chakana; J Kinnear; D Bould,"Background: Caesarean deliveries are increasingly performed at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH), Lusaka, with a 2012 audit report indicating a rate of 17.8%.The procedure is a major surgical intervention and results in higher morbidity than vaginal delivery. Part of this morbidity and mortality during caesarean delivery is that resulting from the anaesthesia relating to the surgery. However, information on the extent of anaesthetic related complications associated with caesarean deliveries in low resource settings such as at UTH is lacking. This study endeavored to explore this aspect.
Objective: To determine the frequency of anaesthetic related perioperative complications during caesarean delivery at the UTH, Lusaka, Zambia
Study Design: A prospective observational study documenting the anaesthetic related complications in women undergoing caesarean delivery at UTH. 246 consecutive parturients undergoing caesarean deliveries were enrolled in the study.
Methodology: All women who presented for caesarean delivery at UTH in Lusaka, Zambia from January 12, 2014 to July 12, 2014 and met the inclusion criteria were recruited into the study. Information on the patient and her management was obtained from the patient’s medical records. Participants were followed up from the time they were taken into theatre, during the procedure until the time they left the recovery room post operatively, and any complication observed was documented. Hypotension, possible aspiration, failed intubation, conversion from spinal to general anaesthesia, severe hypoxemia and death were the main outcome measures. A descriptive analysis was performed. All significant variables were included in the final multivariable logistic model. All tests were set at 95% confidence interval (CI) and a P- value of",Biomedical Sciences,1/28/2021
Effect of Sunflower (Helianthus Annuus L.) on the Suppression of Some Summer Weeds at the Field Station of the University of Zambia,Tamala T. Kambikambi; Olusegun A Yerokun; David D. M Mbewe,"Weeds present a major challenge to crop production and need to be controlled. Several methods of weed control exist but they have proved to be less than successful especially in the tropics; therefore new ways of using these methods are still being sought. The use of allelopathy, a form of biological weed control, has been proposed. A systematic screening of 6 sunflower varieties, a crop known to have allelopathic activities was done at the Field Station of the University of Zambia in the 2008/09 and 2009/10 rain-fed growing seasons using a RCBD with 2 maize varieties as the control. Weed diversity was observed, while weed density, weed biomass and crop yield were measured and subjected to analysis of variance. Results showed that although there was a wide diversity of weeds present,15 were most prevalent. Sunflower varieties, generally, had lower weed density and weed biomass than the control maize varieties. But varietal differences among the sunflower varieties were discerned. The yield reduction was higher in maize grown in a weedy environment than for the sunflowers although here again varietal differences were evident among the sunflowers. It was concluded that the use of sunflower varieties Milika, Record and PAN7352 as an alternative crop can help to reduce weeds in the field.",Agriculture Sciences,12/31/2014

"A Neonatologist's Experience: From Neonatal Intensive Care Unit to Community Based Newborn Care in an Effort to Save Newborn Lives in Zambia, 1985 to 2011",M. Shilalukey Ngoma; Tepa Nkumbula,"As a young scholar, I looked forward to a fulfilling medical career. Being a paediatrician brought with it the idea of saving lives, the smaller the infant, the greater the achievement, so it
seemed. My mentor at the time with the greatest influence on my professional shaping was Professor Chifumbe Chintu, first Zambian Paediatrician, Dean of the School and also head of the
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in C13 and Haematology services for the whole hospital. With this inspiration for a bright and fulfilling career, I set out to train as a paediatrician, with The
Royal College of Physicians in the United Kingdom, supported by the Beit Trust. With the further support of my Departmental Head of the department, Prof. Mukelabai, I proceeded to Mie
University, Japan where with support from the Japanese International Cooperation Agency, I embarked on my career as a neonatologist in 1989 having worked with newborns from
1985. I was exposed to lifesaving feats in Japan's high technology medical milieu. Infants with necrotizing enterocolitis survived well, while birth asphyxia continued drawing its breath from a ventilator for very long periods. To exemplify this iatrogenic effect of success in the newborn period, I experienced and wondered at a five-year-old child who had been premature at birth, still on the ventilator, with family holding on to hope for more than five years. For me, this was the height of the grip technology on all of us. How far will this go? I have not yet found out, because I remain challenged by the mundane fact that newborns are still dying today, the same if not worse than in the 1980s in my own back yard, and our response is far from adequate1,2. And so my move to the world of preventative care, a stint as Reproductive and Child health advisor at the Ministry of Health and World Health Organisation helped stabilize my understanding of my role in neonatology, child-health and whole care of the child in the family setting.",Biomedical Sciences,3/31/2012
"Prevalence of Hypocalcaemia in Term Neonates and the Clinical Characteristics of the Affected Neonates Admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia",Khozya D Zyambo; Silvester Sinyangwe; Chishala Chabala,"Anaemia is a public health problem globally affecting 293.1 million children and 28.5% of these children are in the sub Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of anaemia and the associated risk factors of anaemia in children aged 6 months to 15 years admitted to the University Teaching Hospital. There have been no studies done at University Teaching Hospital to establish the burden of anaemia in children. 
A cross sectional study was conducted from July 2016 to December 2016. 351 children were recruited through convenient sampling methods. Data collection sheet was used to collect socio demographic and anthropometry data. The prevalence, associated risk factors of anaemia, and morphological types of anaemia were determined after blood investigations were done. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 21.0. The association between predictors and outcome variables were measured by using by logistic regression and bivariate analysis. Ethical permission was obtained, consent from parents/guardians was taken and confidentiality was maintained. 
A total of 351 children were studied. The mean age was 3 years (IOR 2-7 years). 45.9% were females and 54.1% were males (P=0.12). The mean cell volume was 74. 5fL.Malnourised children were 37.9% among those who were anaemic as compared to 33.7% in the non-anaemic group.7.4% children had positive malaria by rapid diagnostic test (RDT). 23.8% had a positive sickling test. The prevalence of anaemia was 161/351 (45.9%). Mild, moderate, severe anaemia was 47/161(29%), 86/161(53%) and 28/161(17%) respectively. The age group 6 months to 5 years was the most affected with 59% mildly, 69.8% moderately and 71.4% severely anaemic. On bivariate analysis malnutrition, HIV, malaria, age and sex were not associated with anaemia and there was no statistical difference. Logistic regression analysis revealed that presence of haemoglobin S was the only risk factor independently strongly associated with Anaemia (CI-0.2-0.7), p value-0.001. 
Anaemia is a health problem at University Teaching hospital and the under-five age group is the most affected. Predictors of mild, moderate and severe anaemia is sickle cell disease. Therefore, improving on early screening of sickle cell disease and investigating the role of iron deficiency anaemia are some of the strategies to be advocated.",Biomedical Sciences,3/31/2020
"Patterns of Sexual Assault Victims Presenting to the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia: A Cross-Sectional Study",Eugine Kaunda; Yusuf Ahmed; Bellington Vwalika,"Sexual assault, which encompasses defilement and rape, is a public health and public safety problem with the majority of victims being women and children. The consequences of sexual assault include physical injuries, psychological trauma, depression, suicide or suicidal attempt and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a long-term consequence. Others are unwanted pregnancies and risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). There is little information about the conditions under which sexual assault occurs. The aim of this study was to determine the patterns of sexual assault victims presenting to the University Teaching Hospital (UTH). 
This was a cross sectional study that was carried out on sexual assault victims who presented to UTH over a period of four months from December 2013 to April 2014. A total of 160 participants were recruited, 59 from the Gynaecology admission ward (C03) and 101 from Paediatric Centre of Excellence Child Sexual Assault (PCOE-CSA). Participants were interviewed using an interviewer-administered questionnaire while some data was extracted from victims’ files including documented HIV status. Frequency tables were constructed and characteristics of sexual assault compared between victims aged below 16 years and those aged 16 years and above. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 20. 
The age of 160 victims ranged from 2 to 34 years and the most affected age group was 11-15 years (n=91; 56.9%). Victims were mostly single (n=149; 93.1%), had attained primary education or none (n=102; 63.8%) were unemployed (n=149; 93.1%) and resided in high-density areas (n=144; 90%). Only 7.5% (n=12) of victims tested HIV positive. A positive HIV test occurred 14 times more frequently in victims aged 16 years and above (OR = 14.32, CI = 2.35 – 87.22, P-value < 0.01). Majority of the incidents took place in residential homes (n=110; 68.8%) and these were significantly less common among victims aged 16 years and above (OR = 0.33, CI = 0.11 – 0.98, P-value = 0.05).

"Socio-economic Transformation Among Traditional Cattle Keepers in the Kafue Flood Plain in Namwala District, Zambia",Shepande Chaabila Kalapula; Gear Mumena Kajoba; Iwake Masialeti,"A study involving ninety-eighty traditional cattle keepers was conducted in Namwala's Baambwe and Maala areas with the objective of assessing changes in the value of cattle with respect to shifts in production goals, constraints, coping strategies and the introduction of markets, and government interventions in the promotion of livestock sector. The hypotheses were that different categories of cattle keepers within rural agro-pastoral communities are likely to respond differently to opportunities and constraints from cattle markets and that successful cattle keepers are likely to expand their production opportunities by ploughing capital obtained from proceeds of cattle sales while less successful ones withhold animals from the market unless there is an urgent need in order to realise a longer goal of stock accumulation. 
The results showed that financial security was ranked the first by 35.7 percent of the sample as the most important primary objective for keeping cattle. This is due to the changing economic environment resulting in an increase in the demand of money in the rural economy with available markets. In addition, following the establishment of commercial cattle buyers, the socio-economic situation among the traditional cattle keepers has changed from mere accumulation of cattle for prestige and social standing in society to entering into the market economy. Increased cattle marketing has encouraged transformation in production goals for keeping cattle to acquiring universally accepted and prestigious items such as solar panels, television sets, vehicles, dip tanks, houses, fencing, retail shops etc. However, livestock production remains below its potential due to the effect of recurrent cattle diseases and climatic variability in which government and other stakeholders have come on board to help sustain livestock production. 
It was concluded from the study that cattle keepers are rational economic actors whose production goals and strategies are determined not only by cultural and ideological considerations, but by constraints and opportunities imposed by the wider social, political and economic environment. Transformation has occurred, particularly among successful cattle keepers, accumulating both money and assets. They have responded positively to the introduced cattle markets by selling the surplus of their herds.",Agriculture Sciences,3/31/2014
"Effects of Intensive Phase Antituberculous Therapy on Hepatic and Haematological Parameters in Patients at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia",Glorious Mwaba; Derick Munkombwe; Patrick Kaonga; Mwangana Mubita,"Zambia is a high tuberculosis burden country. Antituberculous medicines are the mainstay of tuberculosis management. There have been several reports of antituberculous drug-related haematological and hepatic adverse effects noted in other settings. Adverse events have healthcare cost and morbidity implications. Prevalence and severity of these adverse effects is understudied in patients at University Teaching Hospitals hence the purpose of this study was to identify haematological and hepatic abnormalities and compare parameters before treatment and after completion of intensive phase among the patients. Factors associated with abnormalities were also determined. A prospective longitudinal study was undertaken at Chest Clinic between April 2018 and July 2018. Study patients were followed up for 2 months. Full blood count and liver function tests were recorded at base-line and at follow-up. Abnormalities were defined according to 2017 Department of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Paediatric Adverse Events. Data were analysed using SPSS version 22.0 Paired t-test and Wilcoxon matched - pairs signed rank test were used to compare parameters. Logistic regression was performed to determine factors that were predictive of abnormalities. A p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
A total of 37 patients were involved in the study. 56.8% of patients were male. Mean age of patients was 36.2 years (19 – 57 years) while body mass index was 21.9 kg/m2. Only 37.8% of patients were sputum smear positive at baseline. 56.8% of patients had HIV co-infection. 45.9% of patients were on antiretroviral therapy.45.2% of patients had grade 1-3 aspartate transaminase derangements at follow-up compared to 29.7% at baseline. 5.4% of the patients had grade 1-3 alanine transaminase derangements at baseline while 9.7% of patients had grade 1 at follow-up. Fewer patients (16.1%) had grade 1-2 anaemia at follow-up while 62.2% of patients at baseline had grade 1-4 anaemia. More patients (46.2%) had platelet derangements at follow-up compared to 25.8% at baseline. Fewer patients had differential white cell count derangements at follow-up compared to baseline. Statistically significant differences in haematological parameters: haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, red, and white cell, eosinophil and neutrophil counts at baseline and follow-up were found. However, no statistical significant differences in red cell indices were observed. Changes in alanine transaminase levels at baseline and follow-up were statistically significant. Logistic regression was performed to determine the effects of age, gender, body mass index, HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy, sputum smear status, and appropriate baseline full blood count/liver function test parameters on the likelihood of study patients having deranged haemoglobin concentration, white cell count and alanine transaminase at follow-up. Logistic regression models to predict deranged haemoglobin concentration and white cell count were statistically insignificant. None of the predictor variables were associated with likelihood of derangements in alanine transaminase. 
Findings of this study show that haematological and hepatic adverse effects were relatively fewer at follow-up and were mostly grades 1-3 in severity. Antituberculous therapy is relatively safe for patients during the initial phase.",Biomedical Sciences,3/31/2020
Assessment of Caregivers’ Knowledge about Medications and Medical Conditions by Time of Discharge in the Paediatric Department at University Teaching Hospital of Zambia,Paul Bowa; Tyson L Mungo; Y’oniene Pierre Yassa,"Discharge is a period of transition from hospital to home that transfers responsibilities from the inpatient health care providers to patients and primary Caregivers. The study assessed Caregivers’ Knowledge about medications and medical conditions by the time their paediatric patients are discharged. 
A Cross-Sectional Study was carried out at University Teaching Hospital, paediatric department in Lusaka city of Zambia. A total of 369 caregivers were assessed on the level of knowledge about their discharged paediatric patients’ medical conditions and medications using data collected by a Pre-Tested Interview administered questionnaire. A knowledge index was developed, representing the number of correct answers. Chi-square test analysis was used to indicate the significance of the results. 
Most Caregivers were married (78.8%),Parents (82.2%), Unemployed(57.7%) with Primary level of Education (45.5%).The study found that 35.5% were very knowledgeable,27.6% had average knowledge, and 36.9 % were not knowledgeable about Medical conditions. 16.5% were very knowledgeable,35.5% were averagely knowledgeable, and 48.5 were not knowledgeable about Medications. The overall knowledge about Medical condition and Medications was poor, with only 11.9% very knowledgeable,35.5% average knowledgeable and 52.6% not knowledgeable. Study of Pearson Chi-square reviewed that there is a statistically significant association between Age(P=0.000), Gender(P=0.023), Duration of Hospital stay(0.000), of education (0.000), Occupation (0.000) and Relationship of Caregiver (0.002) to the level of knowledge. 
Generally, Caregivers were not knowledgeable about Medical conditions and Medications of their paediatric patients. However, the study findings indicated that Caregivers were more knowledgeable about medical conditions than medications. Female parent caregivers are more likely to be knowledgeable than male Caregivers. Similarly, those who stay longer in hospital, with a high level of education, and health workers are likely to be knowledgeable.",Biomedical Sciences,9/30/2020
Diagnostic Accuracy of Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology of Thyroid Nodules at Two Tertiary Hospitals in Zambia:  A Cross-Sectional Study,Jackson Chipaila; Alex Makupe; Evans Malyangu; Daniel Maswahu; Jane C Kabwe; Etienne BFK Odimba,"Introduction: Thyroid nodules are one of the common surgical presentations in Africa and are of great concern because  of  their  potential  to  be  malignant.  Zambia  is  not excluded from these common surgical conditions. However,  there  are  no  preoperative  cellular  or  intra-operative   tissue   diagnoses   of   the   thyroid   nodules   done  before  thyroidectomy  making  it  challenging  to  plan optimal and definitive management. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is known to play a pivotal role in the screening and managing thyroid swellings. This study assesses the diagnostic accuracy of FNAC on thyroid nodules in patients at two tertiary hospitals in Zambia to establish a basis of introducing its use in the management of thyroid nodules at the institutions. Objectives: To  evaluate  the  accuracy  of  FNAC,  as compared to histopathology, in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules  at  University Teaching  Hospital  (UTH)  and Ndola Central Hospital (NCH) in Zambia. 
Methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional study conducted  in  UTH and NCH surgery  department  from June  2014  to  March  2015.  Seventy-three  patients,  who  presented  with  palpable  thyroid  nodules  and  underwent  thyroidectomy,  were  enrolled  in  the  study.  The FNAC diagnosis of the patients was compared to the histopathology finding following thyroidectomy. 
Results: Females made up the majority of the patients (n=67, 91.8%). The ages of the patients ranged from 18 to 78 years. The mean age was 44.3 years, and the peak age of incidence was in the fourth decade. All patients were  clinically  euthyroid  at  the  time  of  enrolment.  The  FNAC  findings  included  23  cases  reported  as unsatisfactory  (31.5%);  29  cases  benign  (39.7%); 2  cases  atypical  (2.7%);  6  cases  suspicious  (8.2%); and  13  cases  malignant  (17.8%).Histopathology findings were available from all 73 tissue samples of participants, of which 55 (75.3%) and 18 (24.7%) were reported  as  benign  and  malignant  respectively.  Of  the  18  malignant  cases  identified  by  histology,  the  most common cancer was follicular carcinoma (n=9, 50%), followed  by  papillary  carcinoma  (n=6,  33.3%)  and undifferentiated carcinoma (n=3, 16.7%). In this study, FNAC had sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive  values,  and  accuracy  of  83.33%,  89.09%,  94.23 and 71.42%, and 87.67% respectively.
Conclusion: In this study, FNAC of thyroid nodules had  a  high  sensitivity,  specificity,  predictive  values and accuracy, and can therefore be recommended to be adopted as a preoperative tool for screening of thyroid nodules.",Biomedical Sciences,6/30/2020
"Prevalence and Outcome of Hypernatraemic Dehydration Among Under-5 Children with Diarrhoea at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia.",Jombo Namushi; Evans Mpabalwani,"Diarrhoea  is  the  second  commonest  cause  of  under-five  mortality  globally  (second  to Pneumonia) and kills one (10 percent) out of every ten children who die before their fifth birthday. In Zambia dehydration due to diarrhoea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among  under-five  children.  Hypernatraemic  dehydration  is  the  most  dangerous  and  fatal form of dehydration. Despite the availability of well known effective treatment modalities for  dehydration  in  diarrhoea,  mortality  remains  high  in  many  developing  countries.  The  situation  is  not  any  different  in  Zambia  and  at  The  University  Teaching  Hospital  (UTH)  Department  of  Paediatrics.  Therefore,  this  study  sought  to  determine  the  prevalence  and  outcome of hypernatraemic dehydration as a possible contributing factor to the high mortality rate  among  children  with  diarrhoea.  It  was  a  cross-sectional  study  conducted  at  the  UTH  Department  of  Paediatrics. The  study  population  was  under-five  children  presenting  with acute  diarrhoea  with  dehydration.  Independent  variables  were  age,  sex,  feeding  modality,  prior ORS therapy, rotavirus vaccine status and serum sodium. The dependent or outcome variables were discharge/mortality and duration of hospital stay. Data analysis was done with the help of SPSS version 20.   There were a total of 148 participants with an almost 1:1 male/female  ratio  (73/75),  the  mean  age  of  14.7  months  ranging  1-60  months.  The  prevalence  of  hypernatraemic  dehydration  was  approximately  19  percent  (29/148)  among  children  presenting with diarrhoea and dehydration. Hypernatraemia was associated with a high risk of mortality (7/29) with an OR 5.8 (adjusted OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.9-8.0, p 0.002), compared to  (7/74)  OR  1.8  (adjusted  OR  1.1,  95%  CI  0.8-2.2,  p  0.06),  and  (5/33)  OR  3.1  (adjusted  OR  2.3,  95%  CI  1.7-4.4,  p  0.03)  for  normal  and  low  initial  sodium  level  respectively.  Hypernatraemia was also associated with longer hospital stay with a mean duration of 3.09 days (74.2hrs) compared to 2.01 days (48.2 hours) and 2.13 days (51.1 hours) for normal and low sodium respectively. Hypernatraemia is prevalent among under-five children presenting with  diarrhoea  at  UTH  department  of  paediatrics  and  a  major  contributing  factor  to  high  diarrhoeal  associated  mortality.  Recognition  of  its  occurrence  through  diligent  laboratory  services is therefore critical for appropriate patient care.",Biomedical Sciences,6/30/2020
"Are Fresh Stillbirths from Caesarean Sections Associated with Socioeconomic Status? A Case Control Study at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia.",Kenneth Chanda; Aubrey Shanzi; Bellington Vwalika,"Introduction: Stillbirths occur worldwide at a rate of 3.2 million per year. There is however lack of interest in stillbirths especially those from caesarean sections. Discrepancy of high stillbirth rates from caesarean sections in low to middle income countries as compared to developed countries may indicate the influence of socioeconomic status. This study was designed to investigate if socioeconomic status is associated with caesarean section fresh stillbirths.
Methods: The study involved 330 women who underwent emergency caesarean sections from October, 2013 to August, 2014. Of these, 110 were cases and 220 were controls. Data collection was done using an interviewer administered questionnaire in the immediate postoperative period.
Results: Low socioeconomic status was associated with increased odds of caesarean section fresh stillbirths. The association was however not statistically significant.",Biomedical Sciences,6/30/2020
"Prevalence and Factors Associated With Renal Dysfunction in HIV Positive Paediatric Patients on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy at the Paediatric Centre of Excellence of the University Teaching Hospital, in Lusaka, Zambia",Mabvuto Kevin Zimba; James Chipeta; Chipepo Kankasa,"Background- Although sub-Saharan Africa has the largest number of children living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), little is known about the prevalence of HIV related kidney disease in these children despite the recognition of HIV infection as a strong risk factor for kidney disease. This study investigated the prevalence and factors associated with renal dysfunction in HIV positive paediatric patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy at the Paediatric Centre of Excellence (PCOE) of the University Teaching Hospital (UTH), Lusaka, Zambia.
Methodology- The study was a cross sectional survey conducted at the PCOE of the UTH in Lusaka, Zambia. Enrolment of all eligible participants was from April to September, 2014. The Inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 months to 16 years who consented or and assented to the study and were on HAART. Renal dysfunction was defined as at least abnormal renal laboratory values in at least 1 of 3 measures of proteinuria, serum creatinine or Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) 60mL/min/1.73m2 for the age and height-adjusted value as defined by The Kidney Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 on two occasions. A file review and clinical evaluation was done by the study physician to determine the factors associated with renal dysfunction. Bloods were drawn for CD4 count, Haemoglobin (HB), Creatinine and Urine was taken for dipstick urinalysis.

Results- Of the 209 participants enrolled in this cross sectional study, 105(50.2%) were females. This study found a prevalence of 8.1% (CI=5.0-12.5), of renal dysfunction among paediatric HIV patients followed up at PCOE. Children aged 13 and above had on average 23 times greater odds for renal dysfunction [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 23.76, and 95% confidence interval (CI) = (5.30 – 106.53), P-value",Biomedical Sciences,6/30/2020
"Factors Influencing Utilisation of Diagnostic Counselling and Testing for HIV among Tuberculosis Patients at Monze Mission Hospital, Zambia",Joyce Mulenga; Lonia Mwape; Patricia Mukwato,"Background
Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) constitute the main burden of infectious disease in resource-limited Countries6. Persons infected with HIV are particularly susceptible to tuberculosis, both from the reactivation of latent infection and from new infection with rapid progression to active disease8. An individual who is HIV-positive has 10 times increased risk of developing TB compared to an HIV-negative person the life time risk is 50% for an HIV-positive person and 5–10 percent for an HIV-negative9. Estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that there are more than 9 million new active cases of TB and close to 2 million deaths per year and that 2.6 million new cases of HIV infection and 1.8 million AIDS-related deaths occur per year6. 
TB programmes have focused on TB case finding and treatment, with little attention to HIV/AIDS interventions. According toDavid, (2004) untreated HIV infection leads to increased susceptibility to infections including TB.  Currently, global estimates show that about 42 million people are HIV infected and almost one third are also infected with TB (WHO, 2005). The dual epidemics of TB and HIV are particularly pervasive in Africa, where HIV has been the single most common factor contributing to the incidence of TB over the last 10 years. TB and HIV are also a growing concern in Asia, where TB accounts for 40 percent of AIDS deaths (WHO, 2005).Therefore, HIV testing is particularly important in TB because mortality among HIV-infected TB patients is reduced if ART are provided (WHO, 2007). 
Main objective: To explore factors influencing utilization of Diagnostic Counselling and Testing for HIV among TB patients.

Design:.A hospital based cross-sectional study was carried out to assess the utilization of Diagnostic Testing and Counselling for Human Immune Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency among tuberculosis patients. Zambia.

Research design: A non-experimental which is exploratory study design was used in this study.The study employed quantitative approachbecause little is known about DCT utilization.

Research setting: The study was undertaken at Monze Mission Hospital chest clinic as it was selected purposively because of the convenience and ease accessibility to the facilities.It was also chosen on the basis that it conducts TB programmes on a daily basis and records showed low utilization of DCT services for HIV among TB patients.
Study population:Men and women aged between 18 and 49 years will be included in the study as the above age group may give consent to DCT (MOH/NAC, 2006). The study will require 226 patients to participate.

Sample: The sample size was calculated using the Epi- info version 6.0 statistical. The sampling frame will comprise all TB patients visiting chest clinic at the time of the study and who meet the set criteria.The participants were selected using simple random sampling method. The sample size was calculated basing on Krejcie and Morgan's18 formula for calculating sample size of a finite population. The calculated sample size comprised 226 participants. 


Inclusion criteria: TB patients within Monze Hospital aged between 18 and 49 years. This group was appropriate because it is sexually active and at risk of contracting TB and HIV infection.Patients will include those who are not critically ill to avoid withdraw before the end of the study. In addition, patients who will consent to participate in the study will be enrolled in the study. 

 Exclusion criteria: TB patients outside Monze catchment referred to the chest clinic will not be included in the study because they may withdraw from the study due to distance. Patients aged less than 18 or more than 49 years who are referred to the ART sites for DCT will also not participate in the study. They may not consent to participate as they may think they are young or old to be at risk of contracting TB and HIV infection.  Patients who will not consent or volunteer to participate in the study will be freely left out.

Data collection tools and technique: Datawas collected using a questionnaire. A structured interview schedule was used to collect socio-demographic data, measured variables and entering results of all the participants under study. 

Pretest: The tool was pre-tested on TB patients at Chikuni Mission Hospital. This hospital was selected because it has similar characteristics as the actual research site. 

Validity and reliability: A semi-structured interview schedule was used to capture data on demographic characteristics and factors results. The interview schedule was developed based on the World Health Organization (WHO) stepwise survey (STEPS) instrument 22. The same instruments were used on all the patients to ensure reliability and validity. Statistical analyses were carried out using IBM® SPSS® Statistics for Windows Version 20.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, and USA). The frequencies and descriptive statistics of the variables were calculated. 

Ethical considerations: Ethical approval and permission was sought from ERESConverge Ethics Committee. 

Main outcome measures: Diagnostic Counselling and Testing utilization among tuberculosis was assessed to determine the level of uptake. An interview schedule was used to assess utilization and determine the relationships among the factors. 
Results:The level of knowledge and confidentiality were statistically associated with DCT.Overall (n=226), majority 150(66.3%) of the patients did not utilize diagnostic counselling and testing services while 76 (33.6%) utilized diagnostic counselling and testing. The odds ratio of confidentiality was OR 0.52-1.637 and P-value 0.050 while level of knowledge; OR was 0.719-45.785 and P-value was 0.048 and the variables were statistically significantly associated with Diagnostic Counselling and Testing. The study showed that the patients who did not utilize DCT had 47% decrease in the odds of achieving high level of knowledge and confidentiality were less than 0.05 and therefore failed to reject the null hypothesis. Multivariate binary logistic regression model predicted that confidentiality and knowledge were associated with DCT at p-value 0.05..
Conclusion:Diagnostic Counselling and Testing utilization was low in the study population. Level of knowledge and confidentiality were the factors found to be associated with diagnostic testing and counselling. The findings suggest the need for information, education and communication as patients lack information on the importance of tuberculosis patients taking up the test.",Biomedical Sciences,1/28/2021
Accuracy and Completeness of Medication Histories in Patients in Medical Admission Ward at the University Teaching Hospital,Melody Mutinta; Lungwani Tyson Muungo; Pierre Yassa,"Background
Quality documentation of medication histories at the time of hospitaladmission with regard to accuracy and completeness is notdocumented at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH), in Zambia. The aim of our study was to assess the accuracy and completeness of medication historiesobtained in patients upon hospital admission.
Materials & Methods
We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study atmedical admission ward, University Teaching Hospital, over a period of 3months. Our study enrolled 322 patients admitted to this ward who were above 18 years of age and were able to communicate verbally, ifnot, were accompanied by a caregiver. Clinical records of these patients were screened to review allmedications the patient was taking and patients/caregivers were interviewed to obtain acomplete medication history. All informationobtained from patients through interviews was compared withmedications recorded in the patient’s clinical records at the time ofadmission to the hospital. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences(SPSS) version 22 was used for all statistical calculations. 
Results
Of 287 clinical records, 175 (61%) incidents of inaccurate medication historiesat the time of admission were identified and that medication histories in clinical records of patients were incomplete or poorly documented.
Conclusion
Our study shows that 61% of medication histories in patients at the time of admission to hospitals are inaccurate. Quality documentation of medication histories in clinical records at the time of hospital admission is poor.",Biomedical Sciences,1/28/2021
"Burden and Risk Factors of Chronic Kidney Disease in Children with Sickle Cell Anaemia Aged 5 – 16 Years at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka - Zambia",Nchimunya Machila; Chishala Chabala; Chisambo Mwaba; Catherine Chunda-Liyoka,"Improved medical care has led to the improved life expectancy of sickle cell anaemia (SCA) patients hence complications associated with SCA such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) are being seen more frequently. Globally, nephropathy of varying severity occurs in 5 to 18 % of the SCA population across all age groups with a third of the adults proceeding to develop CKD while over 30 % of paediatric SCA patients have CKD in Africa. The mortality rate in SCA patients CKD is high. This study sought to determine CKD’s prevalence and risk factors in SCA, which was not available in Zambia before this study. This information will guide targeting and timing of screening for CKD in SCA in children in our population. 
To determine the prevalence of haematuria, proteinuria, abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), CKD, and risk factors of CKD among the steady-state SCA patients aged 5 to 16 years at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH), Lusaka. 
This was a prospective cross-sectional study of 197 children aged 5 to 16 years with SCA at the UTH - Lusaka conducted from August 2014 to July 2015. Demographic and clinical data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Urine and blood samples were used to determine the urine albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) and full blood count /blood biochemistry, respectively. CKD was defined and determined using the Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative 2012 guidelines employing urine ACR, dipstick urinalysis and eGFR. In this study, spot urine ACR and dipstick urinalysis were done and repeated three months later if initial tests were abnormal.Data was analysed using SPSS version 21. Chi-square and t-test were used to compare proportions between groups. The relation between study variables and CKD were examined using logistic regression. 
The mean age of the participants was 9.6 years (SD ±3.6). Male to female ratio was 1:1. The median age at diagnosis of SCA was 22 months (IQR = 44). The prevalence of haematuria, proteinuria and CKD among the study participants was 14.2%, 36% and 36 % respectively. Low haemoglobin and elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were associated with CKD-AOR 0.62, 95% CI; 0.46-0.84 and 1.04, 95% CI; 1.01 – 1.08, respectively. Recurrent admissions (due to VOCs, severe anaemia and febrile illness) were also risk factors associated with CKD- AOR 0.52, 95% CI; 0.27-0.98. CKD was not associated with age at enrolment, sex, age at diagnosis of SCA, recurrent Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOCs) or abnormal liver function tests. The prevalence of CKD among the SCA patients at UTH- Lusaka is high (36%) with lower haemoglobin, elevated MCV and recurrent admissions being risk factors for developing CKD. SCA patients should be screened for CKD routinely at least once a year. Interventions such as the early introduction of hydroxyurea, proactive blood transfusions, and ACE inhibitors can reduce CKD’s risk and its progression to end-stage renal disease.",Biomedical Sciences,9/30/2020
Performance of Spring Wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) Varieties under Water Regimes and Nitrogen Rates,Mushekwa Sakumona; Davies M Lungu; Kalaluka Munyinda,"The high cost of supplying water and nitrogen reduces the planted hectarage and restricts spring wheat production among wheat growers in Zambia. A field experiment was carried to determine twelve common spring wheat varieties’ performance when subjected to water regimes and nitrogen application rates at Nanga Irrigation Research Station in Mazabuka in 2011 winter season. The experiment was performed as a Split-split in a Randomised Complete Block Design with three replications. Water regimes (100%, 75% and 50% crop water requirements (CWR)) were considered as the main factor, nitrogen rates (80, 160 and 240 Kg N ha-1) as sub-factor and variety (Nduna, Shine, Sekuru, Sahai I, Loerie II, Pungwa, Choza, UNZA I, UNZA II, Mampolyo, Nseba and Coucal) as a sub-sub factor. Grain yield, spike length, above-ground biomass, plant height, thousand kernel weight, harvest index, spikelets per spike and number of grains per spike were measured.Mampolyo, Nduna and Pungwa significantly (p < 0.05) produced the same and highest grain yield of 6,473, 6,494 and 6,395 kg ha-1, respectively at 100% CWR and lowest nitrogen rate. At 50% CWR and optimum nitrogen rate, Loerie II (5,351kg ha-1) and Sahai I (6,086kg ha-1) significantly (p < 0.05) produced the same and highest yields. At 75% CWR and 160 kg N ha-1, Mampolyo (5,703kg ha-1) and Sekuru (5,325kg ha-1) significantly (p < 0.05) produced the same and the highest yields and 75% CWR and 80 kg N ha-1,Nseba (5,667kg ha-1), Shine (5,224kg ha-1) and Choza (5,559kg ha-1) significantly (p < 0.05) produced the same and highest grain yields. The optimum and low level of either water on nitrogen or vice versa and 80 kg N ha-1 with 75% CWR offers wide options for spring wheat variety choice for wheat production.It was concluded that farmers could select some varieties with high grain yields based on the input combination suiting their capacity and increase planted hectarage and wheat production.",Biomedical Sciences,9/30/2020
"Night-time Chronotherapy with Diuretics: Effect on Sleep Quality and Duration in Patients with Hypertension in Lusaka, Zambia",David Banda; Tyson L. Muungo; Nason Lambwe,"Poor sleep plays an important role in the prevalence of hypertension. It increases the prevalence rate to 60%. The night-time dosing of blood pressure-lowering drugs has yielded positive results. Scholars have rarely investigated the relationship between night-time dosing of diuretics and the quality of sleep. The study aimed at evaluating quality and duration of sleep while on night-time dosing of diuretics and determine the commonly used blood pressure-lowering medication at University Teaching Hospital. 
The study was a Prospective Cohort Study with 12 weeks follow-up. The sample consisted of 46 patients with hypertension, and on a diuretic, 25 of whom were taking their medication in the evening at 10 PM (study group), and 18 were in the 10 AM dosing schedule as a control. 
Overall, 43 were included in the analysis. Baseline and follow-up at 2, 8 and 12 Sleep quality and duration, and blood pressure level were available for 43 (93.5%) individuals. The study recruited more women (76.1%), and the majority were on hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride combination (65.2%). The 10 PM dosing showed better in quality of sleep and duration, and blood pressure-lowering as the follow-up continued with a p-value of less than 0.05 for Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and for the blood pressure-lowering at 12 weeks. 
The study showed beneficial effects of 10 PM dosing of diuretics in hypertensive patients, and the diuretic effect does not affect the quality and duration of sleep. Further, 10 PM dosing lowers the blood pressure significantly compared with 10 AM.",Biomedical Sciences,9/30/2020
Prevalence and Risk Factors of East Coast Fever in the Copperbelt and Central Provinces of Zambia,David Chipuku Chabala; Martin Simuunza; Bonface Namangala,"East Coast fever (ECF) is an infectious tick-borne disease of cattle, caused by a protozoan parasite Theileriaparva. Itis a disease of major economic importance in Zambia, being the main cause of cattle morbidity and mortality. Despite its economic importance, the epidemiology of ECF in Zambia is poorly understood, thereby making ECF prevention and control difficult. Further, there is limited published literature on this disease in Zambia, with the little available research concentrating on Southern and Eastern provinces. 
We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of ECF in Copperbelt and Central provinces of Zambia. The provinces and districts were selected based on their vast potential for livestock production and the previously reported incidence of ECF. From each district, two veterinary camps were randomly selected and from each camp herds were randomly selected, from which individual animals were randomly sampled. Lymph node biopsies were collected from Mpongwe and Masaiti districts (Copperbelt province) and Kapiri Mposhi and Chibombo districts (Central province). Lymph smears were prepared and stained with Giemsa for microscopic examination. 
Microscopic examination of lymph smears revealed that 6.4% (95%, CI=4.9-7.9) of the samples were positive for T. parva schizonts. The Copperbelt province prevalence was 6.1% (95%, CI=4.0-8.2) while in Central province it was 6.7% (95%, CI=4.5-8.9). Among the districts in these provinces, Kapiri Mposhi did not record any schizont positive cattle, while Chibombo had the highest prevalence at 13.6% (95%, CI=9.4-17.9). Risk factors that were identified to be associated with Theileria schizonts in cattle were locality (district), previous experience of ECF, tick burden, and age. 
These results indicate that ECF is prevalent in Copperbelt and Central provinces of Zambia. Concerted efforts are needed to control ticks and prevent ECF through farmer sensitization, routine, regular, mandatory and supervised dipping or spraying of cattle and stringent livestock movement control to help bring down ECF prevalence.",Veterinary Medicine,1/26/2021
Diagnostic Accuracy of the Alvarado Scoring System in Patients Undergoing Appendicectomy at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka.,Songiso Mutumba; Mulundika J,"Background: The  use  of  the  Alvarado  scoring  system as a tool for diagnosing acute appendicitis has  been  associated  with  a  reduction  of  negative  appendicectomies.  This  study  aimed  to  assess  the  diagnostic  accuracy  of  the  Alvarado  scoring  system at predicting acute appendicitis in patients undergoing   appendicectomy   at   the   University   Teaching Hospital (UTH).
Methods: A   prospective   study   was   done   to   evaluate  the  diagnostic  value  of  the  Alvarado  score  in  patients  undergoing  appendicectomy  at  the UTH. Data was collected from the participants diagnosed with acute appendicitis and undergoing appendicectomy.  The  Alvarado  scores  for  all  the  participants enrolled into the study were tabulated and correlated with the histopathology results. The sensitivity and the specificity of the Alvarado score was  determined  and  used  to  construct  the  ROC  curve using the SPSS version 20. The area under the  curve  was  used  to  determine  the  diagnostic  accuracy of the Alvarado score in this study.  
Setting:  The   University   Teaching   Hospital   in   Lusaka, Zambia. 
Results: To  determine  the  diagnostic  accuracy  of  the Alvarado score the ROC curve test was run in SPSS version 20. The results showed that the area under the curve was C=0.842 with SE=0.047 and 95%  CI  from  0.750  to  0.934.  The  area  under  the  curve represents the probability that the Alvarado score  result  for  a  randomly  chosen  positive  case  will  exceed  the  result  for  a  randomly  chosen  negative  case.  It  shows  from  the  ROC  that  the  Alvarado  score  is  a  good  indicator  to  anticipate  acute  appendicitis.  In  other  words,  these  results  have confirmed that the Alvarado scoring system has  very  high  predictive  ability  to  discriminate  acute appendicitis from normal appendix subjects.
Conclusion: The use of the Alvarado scoring system as a tool for diagnosing acute appendicitis at UTH will reduce the rate of negative appendicectomies. This will lead to a reduction in unnecessary operations, which are a burden on the health care system",Biomedical Sciences,6/30/2020
"Vancomycin Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus Species Isolated at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia: Should We Be Worried?",Matenge Mutalange; Kaunda Yamba; Christine Kapesa; Frank Mtonga; Masiye Banda; John Bwalya Muma; Bernard Mudenda Hangombe; Lottie Hachaambwa; Flavien Nsoni Bumbangi; Geoffrey Kwenda; Mulemba Samutela,"Staphylococcus aureusand Enterococcus species cause invasive infections such as bacteremia and infective endocarditis. Despite vancomycin being the drug of choice for drug-resistant infections caused by these species, few studies have been conducted to ascertain vancomycin resistance in the African setting. This is crucial given the rising resistance in these organisms. This study aimed at isolating S. aureus and Enterococcusspecies and determine their susceptibility to vancomycin and other antibiotics at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. 
This was a cross-sectional study in which S. aureus and Enterococcus spp isolates from the skin, soft tissue and bloodstream infections were included. Standard microbiological and Kirby-Baur (disc diffusion and E-strips) methods were used to identify and determine the susceptibility of the organisms, respectively. 
From fifty-nine S. aureusisolates, thirty-seven were from the skin and soft tissue and twenty-two from blood culture. Twenty-six (44.1%) of these were Methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Thirty-nine Enterococcus were isolated from blood cultures only. Of the S. aureus [16] and Enterococcus [14] isolates tested with vancomycin E-strips, none were vancomycin-resistant. However, 12.5 per cent S. aureus and 14.3 per cent Enterococcus showed intermediate vancomycin susceptibility. S. aureus were resistant to penicillin (93.2%), erythromycin (52.5%) and tetracycline (50.8%). Enterococcus showed resistance to penicillin (83%) and tetracycline (84.6%). 
There was no vancomycin resistance among S. aureus and Enterococcus,implying vancomycin is still a viable treatment option for invasive infections. Given the intermediate vancomycin susceptibility, treatment guided by minimum inhibitory concentration results, continued surveillance and prudent use are key.",Biomedical Sciences,3/17/2021
Assessment of the Price Elasticity of Demand for Veterinary Services: A Case Study of the University of Zambia Veterinary Hospital,Nelly Banda; Eugene C Bwalya; Musso Munyeme; John Bwalya Muma; Chisoni Mumba,"Developing a price policy that ensures financial viability in order to continue providing a service. The same is true for veterinary services whose economic nature has to be understood for practitioners to adjust prices for smooth income flows to the business. However, veterinary practitioners’ prices often vary across practices without a clear understanding of the economic nature of animal healthcare or elasticity of demand for the services they provide. This study, therefore, aimed to assess the price elasticity of demand for veterinary services using the University of Zambia Veterinary Clinic (UNZAVET) as a case study. To meet this objective, historical five-year data (2014-2018) was collected from the clinics’ medical and financial records. The data was then entered and analysed using both Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS Version 20. The price elasticity of demand was calculated using an end-point method. The association between inflation rate and revenue was estimated using Simple Linear Regression Analysis.

"Evaluation of Bacterial Contamination of Beef Carcasses in Namwala and Lusaka Districts, Zambia",Wizaso Wiza Mwasinga; John Bwalya Muma; Clovice Kankya; Chisoni Mumba; Musso Munyeme,"Abattoirs have been purported to be ideal areas were possible microbial contamination of meat products is likely to occur.A total of 314 food of animal origin, mainly, beef, has been identified as a source of dietary protein for humans albeit it being a source of food-borne diseases including zoonoses. This study was carried out to evaluate bacterial contamination and the risk factors associated with contamination of beef carcasses during processing. 
A total offour abattoirs were sampled within three months with one in Namwala and three in Lusaka districts. 314 beef carcass surface swabs were obtained from the neck region by swabbing the carcasses, immediately after evisceration and after washing. 
The results of mean total viable counts (TVC) of carcass contamination were enumerated as the mean log from 4.7 Log10 cfu/cm2in an abattoir where Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) practiced to 5.8 Log10 cfu/cm2 in abattoirs without HACCP. Bivariate analysis showed a significant difference in carcass contamination when town abattoirs (Lusaka) were compared with rural ones (Namwala); χ2 = 43.87, P < 0.0001. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified poor hygiene practices, the absence of antemortem inspection, and lack of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) implementation as significant factors associated with carcass contamination. 
The microbial load of the fresh beef carcasses in Namwala district was higher than that in Lusaka district as determined by the Total Viable Count. This is an indicator that beef is being produced under poor abattoir hygiene conditions. Therefore, beef carcasses with high bacterial loads are potential sources of foodborne pathogens leading to foodborne disease, hence, there is need for advocating for good hygiene practices in the abattoirs.",Veterinary Medicine,5/3/2021
Identification of MHC Alleles Associated with Disease Resistance/Susceptibility in Smallholder Cattle in Zambia,Isaac Kombe Silwamba; Martin Simuunza; King Nalubamba; Joseph Ndebe; Edgar Simulundu; Geoffrey Mainda; John. Bwalya Muma,"The occurrence of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) alleles associated with resistance to Mastitis, Bovine Leukaemia Virus (BLV), Theileriosis, Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and susceptibility Dermatophilosis in African cattle is ill defined. 
The researchers used manual annotation to screen for five MHC alleles previously known to be associated with resistance/susceptibility to these diseases from a database of alleles sequenced from 846 cattle in Zambia. 
Overall, the researchers found twenty-eight (3.3%), twenty-one (2.6%), fifty-five (6.5%), and fifteen (1.8%) animals with resistance alleles to Mastitis, BLV, Theileriosis, FMD; and thirty-nine (4.6%) animals with susceptibility alleles to Dermatophilosis, respectively.

In-Vitro Potential of Crude Extracts of Selected Garden Herbs for Mastitis Management in Zambia,Joshua Ngwisha; Mulemba Tilika Samutela; Bruno Steven July Phiri; Mbawe Zulu; Wizaso Mwasinga; Nair M N Balakrishnan; Kennedy Choongo; Bernard Mudenda Hang'ombe,"The advent of bovine mastitis associated antimicrobial resistance has necessitated development of alternative herbal remedies. In this study, the researchers tested, in-vitro, the antimicrobial efficacy of three crude extracts [1] aqueous, [2] ethanol and [3] ethyl acetate extracts of Zambian cultivated AloebarbadensisMiller (Aloe vera) and Curcuma longa(Turmeric) and made comparisons to synthetic anti-mastitis formulations. 
The active compounds of these herbs were obtained as crude extracts using the solvents water, ethanol and ethyl acetate. The test microbes comprised of ten recognized controls including Escherichia coli andPseudomonas aeruginosa and eighty-four field isolates (all gram positive bacteria) from clinical and subclinical mastitis milk samples from selected districts of the Southern province of Zambia belonging to the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bacillus and Lactobacillus. The agar dilution method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity by observing the susceptibility, which was graded, as susceptible, intermediate or resistant. Commercial synthetic anti-mastitis preparations served as positive controls and their susceptibility was compared to that of the herbal preparations. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) of the herbal formulation was determined using two-fold serial dilutions. 
On average, the agar dilution trials revealed; 41.8 per cent resistance, 13 per cent intermediate and 45.3 per cent susceptibility for the herbal formulation while the synthetic antimicrobials produced 23.5 per cent resistance, 5.2 per cent intermediate and 71.3 per cent susceptibility. The gram negative controls tested were generally resistant.. Mean MIC was 11.5mg/ml at the 5 per cent serial dilution for the herbal extract compared to the Cephalexin (semi-synthetic antimicrobial) MIC for S. aureus at 0.5mg/L or 0.0005mg/ml. 
The herbs Aloevera andCurcuma longa from Zambia showed antimicrobial efficacy on bovine mastitis causing microbes at 5 per cent MIC and could prospectively be assessed as an economical alternative to synthetic anti-mastitis preparations as well as an effective adjunct in fighting antimicrobial resistance to the benefit of the most affected and resource limited small-scale dairy farmers.",Veterinary Medicine,7/5/2021
Challenges and Opportunities for Rural Men and Women in land Conversion Processes in Central Zambia.,Bridget Bwalya Umar; Diana Banda,"Zambia's Lands Act of 1996 provides for the conversion of land rights from customary to leasehold tenure by Zambian citizens and non- Zambians.  This study reports on land conversion processes engaged in by rural men and women of Chongwe and Chibombo districts in central Zambia. Data was collected through 85 semi structured interviews with men and women resident in the two study areas, and several key informants. Results show that 75% and 58% of the men and women interviewed had obtained customary land from their village head persons and 31% and 42% respectively had engaged in land conversion processes. Land conversions have resulted in increased employment opportunities for men; and increased tenure security for unmarried and widowed women. Ambivalence towards the loss of power by chiefs over subjects with titled land, and paying property taxes to the state was evident in both men and women residents in the midst of more secure land tenure rights for their families. Retaining traditional leaders’ authority in the land conversion processes perpetuates discriminatory practices against women and privileges village head persons and men while continuing to disadvantage women. Land conversions are engendering changes in matrilineal inheritance patterns that are more favourable to landowners children.",General,7/12/2022
"Conservation Agriculture and Soil Fertility Improvements: Indications from Smallholder Farmers in Chafukuma, Solwezi , Zambia",Bridget Bwalya Umar; Joshua Sakambuta,"This study assessed the effects of conservation agriculture (CA) practices on soil fertility of smallholder farmers’ agricultural fields in Chafukuma, North Western Zambia. A total of 34 paired soil samples from adjacent agricultural fields in which CA and conventional agriculture (CV) had been practiced for at least five years were analysed for significant differences in plant available phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K), total nitrogen (N), soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil reaction (pH). Smallholder farmers’ CA practices and their perceptions of CA’s effects on soil fertility were investigated through 34 semi structured interviews. Secondary data on CA was collected through desk analysis of CA publications. The study found evidence of CA associated improvements in soil fertility (Tcalc= 4.520, p < 0.0001). This improvement was attributed to the consistent use of good agronomic practices in CA fields whereas these practices were mostly absent from CV fields. The study concludes that CA improved soil fertility in agricultural fields of smallholder farmers in Chafukuma, and could be promoted in CA systems in other high rainfall areas of Zambia provided all the important agronomic practices are utilized consistently. Most of the CA associated agronomic practices could also be extended to CV fields successfully.",Agriculture Sciences,12/16/2021
Morphophysiological Responses of Common Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) Genotypes to Water Stress,Mebelo Mataa; Philip Kalima; Davies Lungu,"The yield of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is highly constrained by water deficit, especially during reproductive development. The purpose of the study was to determine the association of the morphophysiological traits with water stress and how this affects grain yield in common beans. A field experiment involving eight common bean genotypesand three water regimes (50%, 75%, and 100% of crop evapotranspiration) was conducted at the National Irrigation Research Station, Mazabuka District, during the 2012 growing season. A split-plot design, with four replications was used; with soil moisture regime (main plot) and the genotypes (subplot). Based on variation in water stress tolerances, 8 test genotypes - Gadra, KE 3, KE 4, ZM 4488, SER 76 SER 180, SER 89 and CAR-ZAR were used. Water stress treatments were imposed at the pre-flowering stage and were discontinued after forty-three days when the crop was in its late reproductive stage. Significant differences were found among genotypes for Chlorophyll a(Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b), Total chlorophyll, relative water content, grain yield, number of pods per plant, seed weight, seeds per pod and days to 50 per cent flowering under the three water stress conditions. The grain yield in normally irrigated conditions (2191.3 kg ha-1) was 60 per cent higher than in high water stress conditions (866.2 kg ha-1), while in the low water stress conditions (1078.3kg ha-1), the reduction in grain yield was 50.8 per cent. There was a significant genotype by the environment, showing that the genotypes behaved differently under the different growing conditions. Results suggested that Gadra, KE 4, ZM 4488, and SER 180 were water stress tolerant while the SER 89, CAR-ZAR, KE 3 and SER 76 were water stress-sensitive genotypes. These results suggest that a selection method based on 100 SW, Chl a, Chl b, and NPP can be used in breeding for bean genotypes to water stress.",Agriculture Sciences,10/27/2021
Quantitative Exposure Assessment to Vibrio cholerae through Consumption of Fresh Fish in Lusaka Province of Zambia,Mulenga Malata; John Bwalya Muma; James S Siamate; Flavien N Bumbangi; Bernard M Hang’ombe; Chisoni Mumba,"Fresh fish is one of the widely consumed sources of proteins in Zambia. Consumption of contaminated fresh fish has been linked to zoonotic transmission of diseases in humans as fresh fish harbors several spoilage bacteria and pathogens including V. cholerae which cause cholera in humans. This study aimed to conduct a quantitative exposure assessment to Vibrio cholerae through consumption of fresh fish in Lusaka Province of Zambia. We used Swift Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (sQMRA) model to estimate the risk of exposure. We obtained data from reviews of scientific literature, government reports, questionnaire survey, and expert opinions. We categorized fish consumers using three risk pathways; restaurants, households with low socioeconomic status, and households with high socio-economic status.
Results revealed that at a serving portion of 100g in households with low socioeconomic status, a concentration of 50 cfu/g, and infectious dose 50 (ID50) of 106 cells, one person out of 2,251,898 population at risk would get ill, representing a probability of 4.4x10-7. At a serving portion of 200g in households with high socioeconomic status, a concentration of 330 cfu/g, and ID50 of 106 cells, 13 people out of 2,251,898 would get ill, representing a probability of 5.7x10-6. At an average serving portion of 200g in restaurants, a concentration of 50 cfu/g, and ID50 of 106 cells, 47 people would get ill, translating to a probability density of 2.02 x 10-5.
These results indicate that the risk of exposure to Vibrio cholerae through the consumption of fresh fish among the population at risk in Lusaka Province of Zambia is extremely low through all risk pathways. Cross-contamination during preparation and consumption is the main source of exposure to the Vibrio cholerae. Therefore, improvement in good food safety handling and processing would further minimize the occurrence of foodborne illnesses.",Veterinary Medicine,12/16/2021
"Potential Causes of Acaricide Resistance in Rhipicephalus and AmblyommaTicks (Acari: Ixodidae) in Namwala District, Zambia",Karen Sichibalo; Katendi Changula; Chisoni Mumba; Natasha Mwila; Kennedy Chibesa; Benjamin Mubemba; King S Nalubamba; Walter Muleya; Edgar Simulundu; Simbarashe Chitanga,"Acaricide resistance in ticks poses a great threat to livestock production in many parts of the world where ticks are a problem. The objectives of this study were to screen for acaricide resistance in Rhipicephalus and Amblyomma ticks using phenotypic and molecular assays, and to assess current tick control practices used by cattle farmers in the traditional sector of Namwala District. The larval packet test was used to screen for acaricide resistance in ticks covering concentrations up to twice the discriminatory dose for amitraz, diazinon and cypermethrin. Genetic mutations associated with resistance to amitraz (A22C-T8P and T65C-L22S), and organophosphates/ pyrethroids (G1120A) were screened using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Information on tick control practices at the household level was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Intermediate resistance (21-50%) to amitraz and cypermethrin was detected in both Rhipicephalus and Amblyomma ticks, with both tick genera showing susceptibility to diazinon (",Veterinary Medicine,1/3/2022
"Factors Associated with Short Term Outcomes of Hypospadias Repair at the University Teaching Hospitals-Lusaka, Zambia",Seith Kalota; Nenad Spasojevic; Bruce Bvulani,"The study aimed to establish whether age at the time of surgery, glans size, urethral plate width, suture material, urethral catheter blockage/dislodgement and haemoglobin level influence short term outcomes of hypospadias surgery at the University Teaching Hospitals (UTH), Lusaka Zambia.
This was a consecutive (total enumerative) observational cohort study done at D-block and Clinic 7 at UTH Lusaka over nine months. A total of 41 patients were enrolled, and their demographic data, haemoglobin, maximum glans width size and urethral plate size before creating glans wing or midline plate incision were noted and measured. Logistic regression assessed urethroplasty complications on urethral plate size, glans size, haemoglobin, suture material and catheter problems.
The average age of participants was 34 months. Distal hypospadias was the most common type at 61%, while middle hypospadias was 27% and proximal hypospadias 12%. The complication rate was 34%. The most common complication seen was urethrocutaneous fistula at 53%. The other complications seen included 11.8% glanular dehiscence, 11.8% infections, 6% persistent chordee and 6% penile torsion. The risk factors for postoperative complications included the location of the urethral opening. The more proximal the site of the hypospadias, the higher the complication rate. Complications were strongly associated with haemoglobin levels of less than 11.5g/dl (p=0.001) and catheter blockage or dislodgment (p=0.008). There was no association of complications with Socioeconomic status, age at the time of repair, glans width size or suture material. Contrary to the finding of many authors, a wider urethral plate in this study was associated with a higher complication rate.",Biomedical Sciences,12/16/2021
"Determination of the Outcomes of Laparoscopic Appendecectomies at the University Teaching Hospital, Zambia",Rajesh Parekh; Hanna Habib,"Several studies have demonstrated the superiority of Laparoscopic appendicectomy (LA) in managing acute appendicitis. Acute appendicitis has been managed solely by open appendicectomy at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH). This was the first study that looked at the management of acute appendicitis by laparoscopy at UTH. This study aimed at determining the outcomes of laparoscopic appendicectomy at UTH. 
This was a prospective cohort study that included patients that were diagnosed with acute uncomplicated appendicitis. All patients admitted between August 2015 to March 2016 were included in the study. Variables analyses were patient’s data (age, gender, previous surgery, White Blood Cell (WBC)count, symptoms, signs, symptoms), operating time, intra/post operative complications, and length of stay. 
A total of 9 laparoscopic appendicectomies were performed during the study period. The patients had an average age of 31.8 years and were predominantly female (70%). One case was converted to open appendicectomy and was not included in the laparoscopic data group. The mean operative time for the procedure was 75.5 min (range 50-110min) and the length of stay was on average 2.3 days (range 2-3 days). The patients in the study had no complications noted during the follow-up period. No patient developed an intra-abdominal abscess during the study period.
Laparoscopic appendicectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis resulted in good surgical outcomes in this institution compared to the regional statistics as a reference point. It may be preferred in patients presenting with uncomplicated appendicitis or where the diagnosis is equivocal. Laparoscopic appendicectomy is recommended, especially for young female patients in our setting.",Biomedical Sciences,1/3/2022
"Bacteriology and Antibiotic Sensitivity Patterns of Urine in Urology Patients with Indwelling Urinary Catheters at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia",Misinzo Moono; Spasojevic Nenad; Victor Mapulanga,"Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the most common nosocomial infection in hospitals worldwide, and the incidence has been reported to be up to 35%. The growing antibiotic resistance amongst the uropathogens isolated from CAUTI makes it challenging to manage. In Zambia, prolonged catheter use is a burden, particularly in patients awaiting definitive surgery, the elderly and socioeconomically challenged. Bacterial colonisation following catheterisation is inevitable, with reports estimating the risk to be around 5 to 10% per day. By day 10, virtually all patients with urinary tract instrumentation have healthcare-associated UTI, with the duration of catheterisation the most important factor. 
The study was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) over a period of 10 months from July 2015 to May 2016. The cases were in-patients and out-patients with indwelling catheters in situ for not less than three calendar days. Simple random sampling was used to select candidates who were in-patients awaiting definitive surgery and out-patients in the same category as they attended clinics. Data collection and collection of specimens were done by the principal investigator, and then analysed by the microbiologist based at the UTH microbiology laboratory. The patients were recruited at one point, and the data collection exercise employed a questionnaire to collect socioeconomic, demography and clinical information.The variables were collected using the data collection sheet for each participant. The data was then entered into SPSS software to clean and analyse it. The categorical variables were presented as proportions. The main concerns arising during specimen collection were the duration between the time of specimen collection and transfer to and processing at the main laboratory, which was kept within one hour. Specimens received within two hours of the collection were accepted. 
A total of 228 patients were enrolled from both out-patient and in-patient departments. Approximately 75% yielded growth of bacteria, and 25.0% were negative. The pure growth yielded Klebsiella Pneumoniae 28.0% and E. coli 25.2%, as the most isolated pathogens. The antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed the highest resistance of the above isolates to ampicillin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and borderline with cotrimoxazole. The organisms were least resistant to amikacin, imipenem, nitrofurantoin, and gentamycin. Acetinobacter and Citrobacter species were also highly resistant to the above drugs, with nitrofurantoin in addition, but least resistant to ampicillin. 
The study revealed a high prevalence of CAUTI in the urology section of the UTH, and practices such as poor hand hygiene, open catheter drainage, non-aseptic methods of catheter insertion and poor catheter care are possible contributing factors. There is an association between insertion of indwelling catheters and subsequent development of CAUTI, and the strongest factors noted are the size of the catheters used and the patients level of education. High resistance to antibiotics to many organisms of concern was noted.",Biomedical Sciences,1/6/2022
Modelling the Societal Burden of Anthrax in Cattle in Western Province of Zambia using a Modification of Disability Adjusted Life Years,Yolan Banda; Chisoni Mumba; Martin Simuunza; Bernard Hang'ombe,"Abstract Background: Anthrax which is a naturally occurring zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis has been endemic in Western Zambia. This paper estimated the societal burden of anthrax on cattle using Productivity Adjusted Life Years (PALYs) among cattle farmers in the Western province of Zambia. Methods: A quantitative cross-sectional study design was used to collect data from cattle farmers in Mongu, Nalolo and Limulunga districts of Western Zambia. The Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) model for human populations was modified and adapted to the animal population model, PALYs, to estimate the societal burden of animal diseases. The integral calculator was used to estimate the societal disease burden of anthrax using PALY equations in three categories: PALYs without discounting and age weighting, PALYs with only discounting, and PALYs with discounting and age weighting. Results: The results showed that anthrax affected the quality of life years lived by animals significantly due to years lost due to disability (YLD) and Years lost due to premature death (YLL). A cow, bull and ox lost about 34%, 39% and 37% of productivity years of its life span due to anthrax. Anthrax further caused a total loss of 459,280.90 PALYs in the three districts. The quality of life is improved, and productivity losses are reduced to almost 0% for all three types of animals by introducing effective anthrax control measures in the absence of other adverse health conditions. Conclusion: Anthrax negatively affected livestock production due to significant loss of healthy years of life and loss of quality of life. Therefore, it is important to minimize the loss of cattle productivity through morbidity and mortality. Different intervention programs for the same disease can be compared in cost-effective analysis using PALYs as one of the tools. Therefore, societal burden of diseases should also be applied on top of other existing methods used to assess the impact of diseases on animals to enable policymakers to have a complete and comprehensive picture of the impact.",Veterinary Medicine,7/5/2022
Small-Scale Poultry Farmer’s Perception on the Emerging Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic in Zambia,Agboola Olabisi John; Kolawole I Odubote; Metti Richenhagen,"The covid-19 pandemic has been reported to have disrupted the food systems globally, thereby, negatively affecting production of agricultural commodities. This study was carried out to examine the emerging impact of the pandemic on small-scale poultry farmers in Lusaka Province, Zambia. Questionnaires were administered to 100 farmers in Chongwe rural area (Lusaka city sub-hub) to collect information on socio-economic characteristics, poultry production system, impact of covid-19 on poultry operations and coping mechanisms instituted. The data collected were subjected to descriptive and correlation analysis. The research findings revealed that the pandemic has a significant negative impact on the small-scale poultry farmer access to feed availability, vaccines and day old chicks. Similarly, the pandemic had a significant impact on market availability, accessibility and the purchasing power of the consumers. The research also indicated that a significant positive correlation exist between difficulties in accessing essential inputs for poultry productivity and the coping strategy that the poultry farmer adopted. The study concluded that farmers experienced a great effect of the pandemic on their poultry business due to the restriction imposed by government which caused inaccessibility of input supplies and market for the sales of birds. While the government provided financial incentives to some industrial and commercial entities, most small-scale farmers in this study did not benefit from the scheme. This shows that the government is more focused on industrial entities rather than small-scale farmers and producers. The study suggested mitigating strategies such as facilitating access to production inputs, market linkages and financial assistance (soft loans, grants, relief etc.) for small-scale poultry producers to build a resilient poultry system and cope with the emerging challenges covid-19 imposed on the poultry industry are recommended.",Agriculture Sciences,7/6/2022
"Antimicrobial Susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus Isolated from Recreational and Natural Water Bodies in Lusaka, Zambia",Lackson Mwape; Mulemba Samutela; Kaunda Yamba; Annie Kalonda,"Staphylococcus aureus is a potentially harmful human pathogen associated with both nosocomial and community-acquired infections with increasingly antibiotic resistance. Although microbial contamination of marine waters is predicted to be responsible for millions of gastrointestinal, and acute respiratory infections, and several skin infections, there is little information regarding the microbial contamination of water bodies in many Sub-Saharan countries. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the antimicrobial susceptibility of S. aureus isolated from recreational waters and natural water bodies in Lusaka, Zambia. 
This was a cross-sectional study with a total of 90 water samples collected from recreational and natural water bodies. To isolate S. aureus, standard microbiological methods were used while the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was used for susceptibility testing. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was detected by use of cefoxitin. 
The overall results showed that there was 36.7% bacterial contamination in the waters tested. From the 90 samples collected, a total of 33 bacteria were isolated, of which 12 (36.4%) were Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus, 9 (27.2%) were S. aureus and 12 (36.4%) were non-staphylococcus species. All the isolates showed 100% resistance to penicillin G and ampicillin. The S. aureus isolates were most susceptible to chloramphenicol (88.9%), cefoxitin (88.9%), ciprofloxacin (100%), amikacin (88.9%) and gentamicin (88.9%). Only 11.1% of isolates showed phenotypic resistance to methicillin after testing against cefoxitin.
The results from this study signify that recreational and natural water bodies in Lusaka, Zambia may be possible reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus which may possibly be transmitted to humans when using the same waters.",Biomedical Sciences,6/13/2022
Gastric Ulceration and Gastritis in Three Wild Temminck’s Ground Pangolins (Smutsia temminckii) Under Rehabilitation in Zambia,Dr. John Yabe; Dr. David Squarre; Dr. Jackson Katampi; Dr. Rachel Mwenda; Dr. Ntombi B. Mudenda; Dr. Audrine Nkana; Ms. Suwilanji Sichone; Mr. Titus Kaira,"Wild rescued pangolins are known to adapt poorly in their captive environment, where many die under rehabilitation. Gastrointestinal disease and pneumonia are the most common causes of death in pangolins. However, literature on the pathology of gastric ulcers is rare. 
The current case report describes the necropsy and histopathological evaluation of three Temminck’s pangolins that died under rehabilitation in Lusaka, Zambia. Grossly, gastric ulcerations of the fundic gland mucosae were seen in the stomachs. Inflammatory cells and erosions of fundic gastric gland mucosa were seen on histopathology. The morphological diagnosis of gastric ulceration with gastritis was attributed to stress and inappropriate diet.

Pathological and Microbiological Diagnosis of Cutaneous Blastomycosis in a Four Months Old Dog in Zambia,John Yabe; Caesar Luswili; Bernard M. Hang’ombe; Katendi Changula; Daniel Ndambasia; Mutinta Mweemba Muwowo; Maron Mubanga; Evans Mulenga,"Background: Blastomycosis is usually a systemic fungal disease, most commonly diagnosed in dogs and humans. Cutaneous involvement primarily results from hematogenous spread, but in rare cases, direct inoculation can occur. 
Case presentation: The current report describes a case of a four month old male dog presented with cutaneous lesions caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis without pulmonary or disseminated disease. Diagnosis was achieved through histopathology and culture. Surgical debulking associated with systemic therapy with oral itraconazole resulted in significant remission of the lesion. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first case of cutaneous blastomycosis reported in an animal in Zambia. 
Conclusions: Accurate diagnosis of the disease in dogs is of public health importance as canine blastomycosis can be a presage of the disease in humans.",Veterinary Medicine,7/5/2022
A Study of Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy in Adult Patients with Diabetes Mellitus at Levy Mwanawasa University Teaching Hospital,Mpimpa Songiso; Fastone Goma,"Cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is the diminished capacity of autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system occurring in the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and in the absence of other aetiologies. Diabetes mellitus is a well-known cause of peripheral neuropathy. However, in comparison to somatic neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy is an under-diagnosed and under-treated chronic complication of diabetes mellitus despite its serious and significant contribution to morbidity and mortality in the diabetes mellitus population. A variety of tests, based on evaluation of the cardiovascular reflexes triggered by performing specific provocative manoeuvres, have been proposed to measure autonomic function. This study used four cardiovascular reflex tests to estimate appropriate autonomic function by examining heart rate, heart rate variation and the baroreceptor reflex. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in adult patients with diabetes mellitus at Levy Mwanawasa University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. Adult patients with diabetes mellitus, aged between 21 and 70 years, participated in this cross-sectional study. Four, non-invasive, cardiac autonomic reflex tests to assess for cardiac autonomic neuropathy were employed according to Ewing’s method. The parasympathetic function was analysed based on the heart rate response to paced deep breathing and to Valsalva manoeuvring. The sympathetic function was assessed by measuring heart rate and blood pressure response to postural change. Ewing`s criteria was used for the categorisation of cardiac autonomic neuropathy. Data were analysed using SPSS version 20. Continuous data were presented as means and standard deviation. Categorical data were analysed using a Fishers’ Exact Test (χ2) and a logistic regression was performed to verify the effects of diabetes mellitus’ duration, sex and age on the probability that the participants have cardiac autonomic neuropathy. A total of 52 patients participated in the study. The prevalence of Cardiac autonomic neuropathy was 48.1%. Out of 52 patients, 42.3% had definite cardiac autonomic neuropathy and 5.8% had severe cardiac autonomic neuropathy. Early cardiac autonomic neuropathy was observed in 34.6% of patients while 17.3% had no signs of cardiac autonomic neuropathy. The mean age of patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy was 54.44 ± 10.90 years and the mean duration of diabetes mellitus from diagnosis was 5.36 ± 6.78 years. The probability of developing cardiac autonomic neuropathy increased with increasing age and hypertensive participants were more likely develop cardiac autonomic neuropathy (ѵ = 5.82, p = .001). 

In conclusion, cardiac autonomic neuropathy was present in a significant proportion of adult patients with diabetes mellitus at Levy Mwanawasa University Teaching Hospital, reflecting the increased morbidity encountered by this population. In order to improve patient quality of life and reduce disease burden, screening for cardiac autonomic neuropathy should be implemented using cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests which are relatively simple, safe and affordable.",Biomedical Sciences,7/27/2022
Genetic Diversity of Schistosoma haematobium in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review,Rabecca Tembo; Panji Nkhoma; Mildred Zulu; Florence Mwaba; John Yabe; Hikabasa Halwiindi; Moses Kamwela; King S Nalubamba; Chummy S Sikasunge; Andrew M Phri,"Urogenital schistosomiasis caused by the parasite Schistosoma haematobium is the most common form of schistosomiasis. This parasite has a high potential for genetic exchange within parasite populations giving rise to the genetic diversity that is important for its survival. Genetic differences may lead to some parasite strains being more immunogenic, which may have a negative impact on the management and control of schistosomiasis. Therefore, understanding these genetic differences in the parasite may lead to better disease management. This review aimed to systematically review the scientific literature on the genetic diversity and population structuring of S. haematobium and the methods used across sub-Saharan African countries. 
A literature search was done on PubMed, African Journals Online and Google scholar using predefined search terms such as urinary schistosomiasis, S.haematobium, and genetic diversity in sub-Saharan Africa in combination with Boolean operators (AND, OR). The search included studies published from 2000-2020 that emphasised on genetic diversity of S.haematobium in sub-Saharan Africa. A country in sub-Saharan Africa was included if it had a study that determined the genetic diversity of S. haematobium. 
Sixteen study articles from 18 sub-Saharan African countries met the inclusion criteria. The genetic diversity of S.haematobium varied from low to high using different methods. Most studies (18/36 or 50%) in these countries showed a high genetic diversity of S.haematobium. Four methods, namely, restriction fragment length polymorphism, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA, DNA barcoding and Microsatellite markers, were used to determine diversity. In these studies, measures of genetic diversity such as number of alleles per minute or allelic richness, heterozygosity, number of genotypes and unique haplotypes were used. Microsatellites were the most commonly used method, and the studies reported a number of alleles per locus ranging from 2-19 alleles per locus and heterozygosity of 6 to 71% in some studies. The highest number of studies were conducted in West Africa, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, at 4/36(11%) each. 
Results show the need for continued monitoring of genetic variations in S. haematobium in sub-Saharan Africa. This will aid in understanding disease epidemiology and advancing novel treatment and vaccine strategies",Biomedical Sciences,8/12/2022
A Cross-Sectional Study on Socio-Ecological and Socio-Anthropological Determinants of COVID-19 in Lusaka Province of Zambia,Alyce Fri Fonchin; Chisoni Mumba; Linda Basikolo; Simegnew Adugna Kallu; Henson Kainga; Jezreel Mwiinde; Vistorina Benhard; John Bwalya Muma; Musso Munyeme,"The COVID-19 disease constitutes a pandemic that has created an international public health emergency. Besides the significant health challenges, the impact of the COVID-19 disease has been the restriction of movements that have heavily affected the global economy. The first case of COVID-19 in Zambia was identified on March 18th, 2020. By the end of November 2020, the number of districts reporting COVID-19 infections had increased from 68 to 96, with reports of the highest transmission in the capital city, Lusaka, the Copperbelt, and Ndola districts. As COVID-19 spread across the nation of Zambia, several factors are responsible for the spread of the virus. Despite the extensive collection of research done on determinants of COVID-19 disease, the spatial distribution of the disease along socio-demographical and socio-ecological domains remains speculative and infectious diseases have been less looked into in the areas of anthropological dynamics. 
This study used a cross-sectional design to investigate the ecological and anthropological determinants of COVID-19 disease in four compounds in the Lusaka district of Zambia. A guided questionnaire was used to collect data from 301 participants. A descriptive analysis of all independent variables was done. Analysis for associations of dependent and independent variables and multivariate analysis of the independent variables significant at the bi-variate level was conducted to investigate the association between the dependent variable (Knowledge of anyone infected with COVID-19 virus) and the independent variables. 
The bi-variate analysis results showed that 14 independent variables with odds ratios greater than one were significantly associated with the spread of COVID-19. Two variables were found to be highly significant in the multivariable logistic regression analysis model. These included beliefs about COVID-19 (odds = 3.0; p = 0.003; CI 1.2-3.3), and participants area of residence (odds = 2.6; p = 0.003; CI = 1.2-5.5). Other significant multivariate variables were ecological variable; climate and anthropological variables; hand hygienic practices. 
The current research provides further insight into the potential role ecology and anthropology contribute to the spread of communicable diseases. The study recommends awareness of the population to enhance preparedness and response to reduce the spread of COVID-19.",General,9/28/2022
Using Culture Results from Hands and Razor Blades to Sensitise Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) on Infection Prevention Practices,Dorothy Chinwendu Chanda; Seter Siziya; Kumar Sridutt Baboo; Charles Michelo,"This article describes findings from one component of a multi-phased study on infection prevention knowledge and practices of Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) from 2006-2012. 
The study included two activities within the training programme for TBAs, using a modified Ministry of Health (MoH) TBA Training Curriculum. One component of this curriculum involved sensitising the TBAs on two poor infection prevention practices - poor hand washing and cutting babies’ umbilical cords using any dirty, rusted, sharp instrument after tying it with traditional ulushishi (fibre from inside of tree bark). These practices cause maternal and infant morbidities. Seventy-eight out of one hundred intervention TBAs, whose right hands were swabbed for laboratory analysis, were chosen by simple random sampling. The training had theoretical and practical components. They were trained in four groups consisting of twenty-five TBAs in each group. The results showed no growth on the six razor blades after forty-eight hours of incubation, thus proving their sterility. The results from the hand swabbing showed one-hundred and seven isolates that can potentially infect mothers and babies during the birthing process. This result convinced the TBAs on the importance of hand washing. This was evidenced after the training, because the proportion of TBAs who washed their hands before delivering their clients, among the intervention group, was significantly different (p",Biomedical Sciences,5/25/2023
Phytochemical Screening and Acute Exposure of Methanolic Bark Extract of Pterocarpus Tinctorius in Wistar Rats,Isaac Mphande; Andrew Kataba; Kaampwe Muzandu; Angela Gono Bwalya,"The bark extract of Pterocarpus tinctorius (Fabaceae) is traditionally used to treat diseases such as diabetes, gonorrhoea, hypertension, stomachache and bacterial gastroenteritis. However, little is known about toxicity and phytochemicals found in the bark of Pterocarpus tinctorius. Therefore, this study aimed at phytochemical screening and investigating acute oral toxicity of the stem bark of Pterocarpus tinctorius in Wistar rats. 

Wistar rats (N=3 per group) were randomly assigned to four groups: negative control, 50, 300, and 2000 mg/kg methanolic sub-extract. A single dose was administered and female Wistar rats were observed for 14 days according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines for acute toxicity testing in rats. After dosing, rats were individually observed for their physical and behavioural changes throughout the study. The body weight of Wistar rats were monitored weekly and gross pathological changes of rat organs were observed. In addition, the biochemical markers and organ-body weight ratios of the kidneys and the liver were measured. Qualitative phytochemical tests were carried out to determine the types of phytochemicals present in the bark of Pterocarpus tinctorius. 

There were no signs of toxicity observed in all treatment groups and no abnormalities were observed on organs of rats. There was no significant difference in body weight, organ-body weight and biochemical markers with p>0.05, for the Wistar rats in all treatment groups compared to the negative control. Phytochemical tests showed the presence of alkaloids, phenolics, flavonoids, tannins, steroids, terpenoids, anthocyanins and saponins in the stem bark of Pterocarpus tinctoriusas compounds that could be responsible to treat diseases in traditional medicine. 

This study demonstrated that Pterocarpus tinctorius methanolic bark sub-extract is not acutely toxic to the liver and kidneys up to the dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight. It is highly recommended that toxicity studies on other organs of rats such as the heart, brain, pancreas and intestines are carried out.",Biomedical Sciences,9/27/2022

Modeling the Non-Monetary Societal Burden of Tick-Borne Diseases for Cattle: A Case Study of East Coast Fever in the Traditional Cattle-Keeping Households of Namwala District of Zambia.,Natasha Mwila; Chisoni Mumba; Omran Salih; Karen Sichibalo; Edgar S Simulundu; Katendi Changula; Simbarashe Chitanga,"The  study  aimed  at  estimating  the  disease  burden  of  East  Coast  Fever  (ECF)  among  rural cattle-keeping households of Namwala District of Zambia using Productivity Adjusted Life Years (PALYs). We modified Disability Adjusted  Life  Year  (DALY)  equations  for  humans  to  PALYs  to  estimate  the  societal  burden   of   tick-borne   animal   diseases.   We  used  a  structured  questionnaire  to  collect   data   on   parameters   that   feed   into   PALY   equations   and   then   coded   and  entered  data  from  the  questionnaires  directly  into  the  Statistical  Package  of  Social  Sciences  (IBM  SPSS  Version  20).  Further,  we  entered  the  estimated  values  of  PALY  parameters  into  mathematical calculus software called integral calculator (https://www.integral-calculator.com/). We  then  used  the  integral  calculator  to  calculate PALY equations, which we used to  estimate  the  societal  disease  burden  of  ECF  in  cattle.  Productivity  Adjusted  Life  Years   calculations   were   done   in   three   categories;   PALYs   without   discounting   and   age   weighting,   PALYs   with   only   discounting,  and  PALYs  with  discounting  and age weighting.Results revealed that the years of the productivity  lost  by  a  cow,  bull,  and  ox  that suffered from ECF were estimated at 15, 10, and 15 years, respectively. In the second category, the years of productivity lost  by  a  cow,  bull,  and  ox  were  seven,  six, and seven years, respectively. In the final category, the years of productivity lost  by  a  cow,  bull,  and  ox  were  five years. East  Coast  Fever  caused  a  total  of  517,165   PALYs   in   Namwala   District.   The  quality  of  life  reduced  in  years  due  to  disability  (YLD)  caused  by  ECF  per  cow,  bull,  and  ox  was  0.07,  0.07,  and  0.02  per  cent  of  their  life  expectancy,  respectively. The estimated values for the years  of  a  lifetime  lost  due  to  mortality  (YLL)  caused  by  ECF  were  35%,  49%,  and  35%  of  the  life  expectancy  per  cow,  bull,  and  ox.  These  results  are  essential  for measuring outcomes of animal health problems in terms of PALYs. The findings are  helpful  in  the  future  projections  for  the  future  burden  of  any  disease  and  can  be used as a basis in policy and decision-making,  particularly  priorities  in  animal  health   research.   We   recommend   that   a  classification  of  animal  diseases  of national   economic   importance   should   consider  both  the  societal  burden  (non-monetary) and economic impact instead of the common practice of only considering the economic (monetary) impact.",Veterinary Medicine,11/3/2022
"A Deterministic Risk Assessment of the Human Exposure to Cadmium, Lead and Chromium Through the Consumption of Well and Bottled Water in Lusaka District, Zambia",Mkuzi Banda; John Bwalya Muma; Flavien N. Bumbangi; Ethel M'kandawire; Mercy Mukuma; Musso Munyeme; Grace Musawa; Enock M Ndaki; Vistorina Benhard; Chisoni Mumba,"The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal number six is to ‘Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, which is an essential component for human survival. Access to safe drinking water is essential for health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. Safe drinking water implies that the water does not represent any significant risk to health over a lifetime of consumption, including different sensitivities that may occur between life stages. However, water is prone to contamination with heavy metals through natural and anthropogenic sources, making it unsuitable for human consumption due to the cumulative potential risks associated with the presence of heavy metals.

This study was conducted to assess the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk of human exposure to cadmium, lead and chromium through the consumption of well and bottled water in Lusaka district of Zambia. Secondary data was used to determine the mean concentrations of heavy metals in well and bottled water in Lusaka district as well as to calculate the hazard index (non-carcinogenic risk) and cancer risk for the metals under study.
 
The results revealed that a hazard index for cadmium, lead and chromium in both well and bottled water was higher than 1, indicating adverse effects on human health over a lifetime of consumption. Similarly, the total cancer risk through exposure to cadmium and chromium in well and bottled water was 1.2 x 10-1 and 2.25 x 10-1, respectively, higher than the safe threshold limit set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) of 1 × 10−4.

The study concludes that there is a possible non-carcinogenic risk of exposure to cadmium, lead and chromium through the consumption of well and bottled water in Lusaka district. Further, the study concludes that there is a possible carcinogenic risk of exposure to cadmium and chromium through the consumption of both well and bottled water. Owing to the proportion of both well and bottled water samples that exceeded the Zambia Bureau of Standards threshold limit, cadmium poses the greatest concern and requires intervention to reduce exposure. Therefore, it is recommended that heavy metal concentrations in drinking water should be periodically monitored to minimize health risks to consumers.",General,2/28/2023
"Assessing the Impacts of Land Use Land Cover Change In Mutama Bweengwa Catchment of Southern Province, Zambia",Stephen Lungomesha; Lydia M Chabala,"Climate  change  and  land  use  land  cover  directly impact the alteration of hydrological cycles,  making  water  more  unpredictable  and  increasing  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  floods  and  droughts.  However,  proper planning   of   adaptation   and   mitigation   options  is  hampered  by  inadequate  up-to-date  information  on  land  use/Land  cover  in many catchments and sub-catchments of Zambia  and  other  developing  countries.  This study assessed the land use change in the  Mutama Bweengwa  River  Catchment  of Southern Zambia. The objective of the study  was  to  investigate  land  use  land  cover  changes  (LULCC)  in  the Mutama Bweengwa   Catchment   in   the   Southern   Province  of  Zambia  from  2000  to  2021.  The data used for the study were satellite images  of  the  area  downloaded  from  the  United States Geological Survey (USGS). Specifically, the Landsat images were from path 172/row 71 and path 172/row 72 for the period 2000, 2007, 2014 and 2021. The methods used included data identification and   acquisition,   image   pre-processing,   image  processing,  accuracy  assessment,  validation  and  presentation.  Image  pre-processing was used to correct distortions during  image  acquisition.  The  techniques  used    were:    image    enhancement    for    extracting     useful     information,     which     involved  carrying  out  band  combination  and   brightness   and   contrast   adjustment   when  conducting  the  mosaicking  process  using  ERDAS  imagine  2014.  Supervised  classification  based  on  the  maximum likelihood  algorithm  in  ERDAS  Imagine  was employed to generate the land use land cover  classification  and  later  exported  in ArcMap 10.7.1 for map creation. The image classification  was  based  on  six  different LULC  classes,  which  were:  water  body,  build-up/settlement, forest, cultivated land-rainfed/bare  land,  cultivated  land-irrigated,  and  grasslands.  Preliminary  results  of  this  study have shown a decrease in the classes of  water  bodies  and  forest  areas  by  0.34%  and  55.5%,  respectively,  over  the  21-year  period.  The  accuracy  of  the  resultant  land  use/land  cover  maps  was  evaluated  with  the  kappa  statistic  and  error  matrix.  The  preliminary   results   have   also   shown   an   increase  in  the  land  use  land  cover  class  categories    of    cultivated    land-irrigated,    grassland, cultivated land-rain fed/bare land and  built  up/settlements  by  0.13%,  46.7%,  14.6%and 8.4%, respectively. In conclusion, the supervised classification of  the  Landsat  images  indicated  pronounced  land  cover  changes  over  the  21-year  period.  Although this provides preliminary conclusions, it  indicates  that  immediate  actions  should  be  taken  to  protect  the  sub-catchment  from  further loss of land cover by strengthening the regulatory  framework.  Further  work  on  the  project  is  expected  to  bring  out  some  of  the  factors that have contributed to this change.",Agriculture Sciences,3/2/2023
Towards the Development of a Finger Millet (Elesine Coracana) l. Garten) Breeding Programme in Zambia: A Multivariate Analysis of Agronomic Traits of Mutation Derived Lines,Racheal Nyembezi Nguluwe Msikita; Davies Malekani Lungu; Richard Chanda,"Finger  millet  (Eleusine  coracana  (L.) Gaertn)  is  one  of  the  climate-resilient  cereal   crops   with   the   potential   to   mitigate  the  effect  of  climate  change among  the  smallholder  farmers  who  are the major growers of finger millet. It can adapt to extreme environmental conditions and grow under a wide range of diverse agroecologies, which is an advantage  to  breeding  high-yielding stress-tolerant   genotypes. However, the strength of breeding high-yielding, climate-resistant  genotypes  is  highly  or  largely  dependent  on  the  genetic  information    of    the    base    breeding    population. The lack of knowledge on the genetic information of finger millet in Zambia has hampered the breeding of climate-resilient genotypes. Therefore, a  study  assessed  the  diversity  of  M6mutant   lines.  The mutants were  selected  from  a  pure  line  selection  derived from a landrace finger millet variety called Mutubila.The Mutubila pure  line  was  irradiated  with  a  dose  of  100gy  gamma  rays.  The  irradiated  seed  was  planted  to  raise  the  M1 generation  for  eventual  advancement to the sixth generation. From the M2 to M4 generations, mutants were selected based  on  the  number  of  productive tillers  and  finger  length  using  the independent culling selection approach at a selection intensity of 10%.  In  the  M5 and  M6 generations, however,  the  selection  of  advanced lines   was   expanded   to   include   the   number  of  fingers  per  ear  head  and other  important agronomic  traits. This resulted in 40 mutant lines being selected in the M6 generation. The 40 mutant  lines  and  eight  checks  were  planted using an Alpha Lattice design with two replications and eight blocks. The  48  genotypes  were  evaluated for  agronomic  performance,  and  the  data  collected  was  analysed  using  R  software. The  results  revealed  that the  mutant  lines  were  diverse  in  the number of productive tillers per plant (3  to  15),  main  ear  length  (4.4  to 14.5cm),  number  of  fingers  per  ear head (3 to 17) and grain yield (0.58 to 2.95tons/ha).   The  yield  components  (number  of  productive   tillers,   Finger   length, number  of  fingers,  strawweight,  and thousand  seed  weight)  were  strongly  and positively correlated to grain yield (R2  >  0.67)  as  well  as  strongly  and positively  inter-correlated.  Days  to flowering were weakly and negatively correlated to grain yield (R2 > -0.17.The Mahalabonis analysis grouped the  genotypes  into  ten  (10)  clusters,  with  cluster  I  having  the  highest number of sub-clusters (11) and cluster IX and X having the lowest sub-clusters (1).  The  highest  inter-cluster  distance  (>  572,618)  was  observed  between clusters  V  and  IV;  V  and  VII;  V  and  IX;  and  VII  and  XI,  indicating  wider  divergence among these clusters.

"Effect of Graded Levels of Sorghum bicolor on Proximate Composition, Lipid Oxidation, Microbial Load and Sensory Properties of Rabbit Meat Floss",Opeyemi Adediran; G Williams; R Raji; O K Ajibola; O Abunsango,"Consumers are increasingly seeking healthier and more sustainable meat products. Rabbit meat is generally considered a healthier alternative to red meat because of its low fat and cholesterol content. However, people accustomed to consuming red meat may find it less visually appealing because of its pale appearance. Plants rich in beneficial phytochemicals like Sorghum bicolor (Sorghum) have been used to impart desirable colouration and sensory properties to processed foods. 
In this study, Rabbit Meat Floss (RMF) was prepared with graded levels of powdered sorghum stalks thus: Treatment 1/Control (RMF+0% Sorghum), Treatment 2 (RMF + 1%Sorghum), Treatment 3 (RMF+2%Sorghum) and Treatment 4 (RMF+3% Sorghum). The RMF were analysed for Yield (%), Microbial load (logCFU/g), Lipid oxidation (mgMDA/kg), Proximate composition (%), and Sensory properties at intervals of 0, 10, and 20 days. The RMF analysed on days 10 and 20 were packed in Ziploc bags and kept at room temperature. The experimental design was completely randomised, and all analyses were done in triplicates.All treatments with Sorghum inclusion had higher yields than the Control, with Treatment 3 (RMF+2%Sorghum) having the highest yield (107.98). All RMF with Sorghum had higher crude protein than the control. Treatment 2 (RMF+1% sorghum) had the highest crude protein at days 0 (50.67) and 20 (47.85). Ash content was also higher in RMF with sorghum, and Treatment 4(RMF+3%Sorghum) had the highest values at days 0 (9.00) and 20 (8.49). At day 0, Treatment 3 (RMF+2%Sorghum) was rated highest in tenderness (7.00) while Treatment 2 (RMF+1%Sorghum) was rated highest in juiciness, and Treatment 4 (RMF+3%Sorghum) rated highest in colour (8.10). On day 20, all RMFs with sorghum had higher colour scores, with Treatment 4 (RMF+3% Sorghum) having the highest score (8.10). There were no significant differences in microbial load during the study. 
The inclusion of Sorghum bicolor in rabbit meat floss significantly improved its crude protein and ash content. It also improved visual appeal, while overall acceptability was not severely comprised up to 20 days of storage.",Agriculture Sciences,6/1/2023
Kaposia's Sarcoma Trends in the Era of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy in Zambia,Lubinda Mukololo; Lorenda Temwani Phiri; Memory Chisha; Florence Mwaba; Rabecca Tembo; Mildred Zulu,"AIDS-related Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS) is a multi-centric angiogenic neoplastic proliferation predominantly seen in individuals with Human Immune Virus (HIV-1) infection and men who have sex with men. Although the incidences of aggressive KS have reduced following the introduction of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) in the treatment of HIV infection, the effect of HAART rollout in relation to population KS incidence in Zambia remains unclear as cases of the malignancy have continued to be reported. This study, investigated the trends of KS in the era of HAART in Zambia. The researchers conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study. Three hundred and twentycases of HIV-infected individuals on HAART that developed KS between 2008 and 2017 were reviewed. Data was retrieved from the Zambia National Cancer Registry (ZNCR). Of the records reviewed, the researchers observed a sharp increase in KS cases from 5.6 per cent in 2008 to 21.2 per cent in 2014; from 2015 to 2017, there was a general decline in KS cases countrywide in both sexes from 13.1 per cent to 9.4 per cent. KS was more prevalent in Lusaka Province, while Western Province had the least number of cases. For each province, there were more males affected by KS than females. The researchers further observed that 19.1 per cent of the cases reviewed developed KS while on HAART, while 80.9 per cent developed KS before the commencement of HAART. The age group with the highest number of KS cases was 21-40 years, while the age group ≥ 80 had the least number of cases. Our data has shown that although there has been a general decline in KS cases across the ten provinces of Zambia in recent years, more efforts are still required to mitigate AIDS-related KS incidence and improve KS prognosis. There is a need to encourage efforts aimed at HIV infection prevention, wide coverage of HAART across the country, and KS awareness and screening.",Biomedical Sciences,6/1/2023
