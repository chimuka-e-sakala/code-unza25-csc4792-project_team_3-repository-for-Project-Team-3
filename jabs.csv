Performance of Cowpea Progenitor and Hybrids in Varying Concentration Levels of Phosphorus in Hydroponic Setup.,"Among abiotic factors limiting cowpea productivity, phosphorus (P) is an important element. However, in Zambia, no study has determined optimal soil P concentrations for the available cowpea germplasm. The objectives of this study were (i) to identify cowpea genotype that performs better in different concentration levels of phosphorus in hydroponic setups, and ii) to determine the phenotypic response of agronomic variables in different concentration levels of phosphorus. The experiment was set up as 4 x 10 completely randomized design (CRD) replicated 3 times, with 4 doses of P, thus, 0mg/L, 4.7mg/L, 9.3mg/L and 13.95mg/L in nutrient medium and ten genotypes (G). Genotype LT BT1h was identified as a better performer across P concentration. Further exploration of G x P interaction main effects revealed that genotype LT BT1 h performed better than the progenitor in all doses of P concentration except in a medium with 9.3mg/L and 13.95mg/L. Overall, the results showed that applying a concentration above 9.3mg/L P impeded seedling productivity. Significant better performances were obtained with shoot biomass, plant biomass and shoot length of measured variables, implying that the identified variables in varying levels of P concentration can initially be used to aid in selecting for high performing genotypes. The identified novel and best-performing cowpea hybrids for economic traits be recommended for further evaluation.",Agriculture Sciences
Exploring Dietary Patterns and Nutrition Status of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients attending a Teaching Hospital in Zambia,"This study explored food consumption patterns based on the Zambian Food-Based Dietary Guidelines and assessed the nutritional status of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients attending a diabetic clinic at a teaching hospital in Zambia. A cross-sectional design with quantitative methods was employed for data collection, analysis, and presentation. The hospital was purposively selected as it is the only teaching hospital in the district. A total of 146 consecutively diagnosed T2DM patients were recruited during the study period. Data on the types and frequency of food consumption across the six food groups were collected using a researcher-administered questionnaire. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated using standard procedures for measuring height and weight. Blood glucose readings were extracted from patient records. Research tools were pre-tested on a separate group of T2DM patients not included in the main study. Results showed that 87% of participants had received dietary counselling following their diagnosis. Nearly all participants (97.3%) had consumed foods from the cereals, starchy roots, and tubers group in the previous seven days. While a high proportion (87.7%) reported vegetable consumption during the recall period, the mean vegetable intake score was relatively low (2.00 ± 1.24 SD). Only a quarter (25.3%) reported fruit consumption, with a mean score of 0.32 ± 0.61 SD. Over one-third of participants (36.3%) were overweight, with women comprising the majority (39.3%). BMI was significantly associated with age and sex (p < 0.05), whereas marital status, occupation, and education level showed no significant association (p > 0.05). The findings suggest that while patients generally adhered to the Zambian Food-Based Dietary Guidelines by consuming foods from all six food groups, fruit and vegetable intake remained suboptimal. Additionally, the high prevalence of overweight and obesity highlights the need for targeted interventions to promote healthier dietary practices among T2DM patients.",Agriculture Sciences
Programmed Death Ligand-1 Expression in Gastric Cancer Cases in Zambia,"Gastric cancer is a highly fatal disease in Zambia due to delayed diagnosis, aggressiveness of the disease and ineffective treatment. Programmed death ligand-1 is a key biomarker of gastric cancer, linked to immune evasion and response to anti- Programmed death ligand-1 therapies. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of in gastric cancer cases and its association with various clinicopathological prognostic factors in Zambia. This pilot study utilized archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from patients diagnosed with gastric cancer at the University Teaching Hospitals in Lusaka, Zambia. A total of 41 gastric cancer samples were examined, with 65.9% female (27) and 34.1% male (14), and a median age of 63 years (interquatile range: 56–76). The slides were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin, followed by immunohistochemical analysis to assess Programmed Death Ligand-1 expression, which was evaluated using a combined positive scoring system. Statistical analysis was conducted using STATA, version 15. Six patients (14.6%) exhibited positive expression of Programmed Death Ligand-1, with a combined positive score of 1 or higher. However, our analysis did not reveal any significant associations between PD-L1 expression and any of the clinicopathological variables assessed. We found that a small proportion (14.6%) of GCs in our population express Programmed Death Ligand-1, identifying a potentially therapeutically actionable patient group.",Biomedical Sciences
"Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia-Associated Fetal Wastage and Meat Quality Compromise in Cattle Slaughtered at Dr Abubakar Saraki Memorial Abattoir, Kwara State, Nigeria","Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is still endemic in Nigeria. The Mycoplasma Unit of the Department of Veterinary Microbiology, University of Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria, has completed an 18-month investigation of CBPP cases encountered at the main city abattoir. Investigation was with special emphasis on fetal wastes, physical and health conditions of cattle presented for slaughter at the abattoir. Blood and tissues samples were obtained during ante mortem and postmortem examinations for laboratory investigations and diagnosis of CBPP were based on classical pathological lesions and culture of Mycoplasma organism identified serologically as M. mycoides subsp. mycoides from lung lesions and pleural fluids obtained from the cattle. From a total of 41,069 cattle slaughtered, 40,075 (97.6%) were cows from which 6,699 fetuses were encountered, and 963 (2.3%) were bulls. Thus, an average of 372 fetuses was wastedeach month at the abattoir. Of the 40,075 cows slaughtered, 913 (2.3%) were CBPP-positive and carried 153 fetuses. Most cows carried twin fetuses.We estimate that each fetal wastage is equivalent to 50,000 Naira losses to the farmer, and each emaciated animal slaughtered is a loss of approximately 200,000 Naira.Studies are warranted to determine annual national economic losses resulting from slaughtering emaciated cattle that are often discovered to be pregnant, and propose strategies to address the avoidable revenue loss.",Veterinary Medicine
Potential of a Powdered Mopane Worms-Breakfast Meal Blend as a Nutritious Porridge for Children in Zambia,"In Zambia, the intake of animal-sourced proteins remains low in many households, despite their essential role in supporting physical growth, cognitive development in children, and overall health in adults. Among edible insects, Mopane worms are widely consumed and offer a protein content comparable to that of conventional meats. However, there is limited research on incorporating Mopane worms into cereal-based foods such as porridge to enhance their nutritional value, and little is known about the nutritional composition and consumer acceptability of such products. This study investigated the nutritional attributes and consumer acceptance of porridge made from two Mopane worm breakfast meal composite blends and one conventional breakfast meal. Mopane worms (variety Mumpa kaseke) were sourced from Muchinga Province and processed under clean, dry conditions. Two composite blends were formulated following World Food Programme super cereal guidelines: MB80 (80% breakfast meal and 20% Mopane worm powder) and MB75 (75% breakfast meal and 25% Mopane worm powder). The samples were analyzed in triplicate for proximate composition and mineral content (calcium, iron, and zinc) using AOAC (2005) methods. Consumer acceptability was also assessed for the three porridge types. Results indicated that Mopane worm powder had a high protein content (55.60 ± 4.01%). The MB80 and MB75 composite blends contained 16.74 ± 1.98% and 19.04 ± 1.11% protein, respectively. MB75 had higher iron content (1.74 ± 0.74%) than MB80 (1.04 ± 0.19%), while MB80 had more zinc (0.57 ± 0.11%) than MB75 (0.41 ± 0.74%). Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found in proximate and mineral composition across the three samples. Between MB80 and MB75, only moisture, ash, and crude fiber differed significantly. In terms of sensory attributes, consumer acceptability ratings for aroma, taste, and overall preference showed no significant differences (p < 0.05) among the three porridge types. Similarly, there were no significant differences between MB80 and MB75 in terms of consumer ratings for any attribute. In conclusion, the inclusion of Mopane worm powder into breakfast meals significantly improved the nutritional content of porridge, especially in protein, fat, and fibre, while maintaining consumer acceptability. These findings highlight the potential of insect-based composite flours as a sustainable approach to enhancing dietary protein intake and addressing malnutrition in low-income settings.",Agriculture Sciences
