Performance of Cowpea Progenitor and Hybrids in Varying Concentration Levels of Phosphorus in Hydroponic Setup.,Emmanuel Chikalipa,"Among abiotic factors limiting cowpea productivity, phosphorus (P) is an important element. However, in Zambia, no study has determined optimal soil P concentrations for the available cowpea germplasm. The objectives of this study were (i) to identify cowpea genotype that performs better in different concentration levels of phosphorus in hydroponic setups, and ii) to determine the phenotypic response of agronomic variables in different concentration levels of phosphorus. The experiment was set up as 4 x 10 completely randomized design (CRD) replicated 3 times, with 4 doses of P, thus, 0mg/L, 4.7mg/L, 9.3mg/L and 13.95mg/L in nutrient medium and ten genotypes (G). Genotype LT BT1h was identified as a better performer across P concentration. Further exploration of G x P interaction main effects revealed that genotype LT BT1 h performed better than the progenitor in all doses of P concentration except in a medium with 9.3mg/L and 13.95mg/L. Overall, the results showed that applying a concentration above 9.3mg/L P impeded seedling productivity. Significant better performances were obtained with shoot biomass, plant biomass and shoot length of measured variables, implying that the identified variables in varying levels of P concentration can initially be used to aid in selecting for high performing genotypes. The identified novel and best-performing cowpea hybrids for economic traits be recommended for further evaluation.",Agriculture Sciences,26/06/2025
Exploring Dietary Patterns and Nutrition Status of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients attending a Teaching Hospital in Zambia,"Nixon Miyoba, Abidan Chansa","This study explored food consumption patterns based on the Zambian Food-Based Dietary Guidelines and assessed the nutritional status of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients attending a diabetic clinic at a teaching hospital in Zambia. A cross-sectional design with quantitative methods was employed for data collection, analysis, and presentation. The hospital was purposively selected as it is the only teaching hospital in the district. A total of 146 consecutively diagnosed T2DM patients were recruited during the study period. Data on the types and frequency of food consumption across the six food groups were collected using a researcher-administered questionnaire. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated using standard procedures for measuring height and weight. Blood glucose readings were extracted from patient records. Research tools were pre-tested on a separate group of T2DM patients not included in the main study. Results showed that 87% of participants had received dietary counselling following their diagnosis. Nearly all participants (97.3%) had consumed foods from the cereals, starchy roots, and tubers group in the previous seven days. While a high proportion (87.7%) reported vegetable consumption during the recall period, the mean vegetable intake score was relatively low (2.00?±?1.24 SD). Only a quarter (25.3%) reported fruit consumption, with a mean score of 0.32?±?0.61 SD. Over one-third of participants (36.3%) were overweight, with women comprising the majority (39.3%). BMI was significantly associated with age and sex (p?<?0.05), whereas marital status, occupation, and education level showed no significant association (p?>?0.05). The findings suggest that while patients generally adhered to the Zambian Food-Based Dietary Guidelines by consuming foods from all six food groups, fruit and vegetable intake remained suboptimal. Additionally, the high prevalence of overweight and obesity highlights the need for targeted interventions to promote healthier dietary practices among T2DM patients.",Agriculture Sciences,26/06/2025
Programmed Death Ligand-1 Expression in Gastric Cancer Cases in Zambia,"Husna Munshi, Violet Kayamba","Gastric cancer is a highly fatal disease in Zambia due to delayed diagnosis, aggressiveness of the disease and ineffective treatment. Programmed death ligand-1 is a key biomarker of gastric cancer, linked to immune evasion and response to anti- Programmed death ligand-1 therapies. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of in gastric cancer cases and its association with various clinicopathological prognostic factors in Zambia. This pilot study utilized archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from patients diagnosed with gastric cancer at the University Teaching Hospitals in Lusaka, Zambia. A total of 41 gastric cancer samples were examined, with 65.9% female (27) and 34.1% male (14), and a median age of 63 years (interquatile range: 56Ð76). The slides were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin, followed by immunohistochemical analysis to assess Programmed Death Ligand-1 expression, which was evaluated using a combined positive scoring system. Statistical analysis was conducted using STATA, version 15. Six patients (14.6%) exhibited positive expression of Programmed Death Ligand-1, with a combined positive score of 1 or higher. However, our analysis did not reveal any significant associations between PD-L1 expression and any of the clinicopathological variables assessed. We found that a small proportion (14.6%) of GCs in our population express Programmed Death Ligand-1, identifying a potentially therapeutically actionable patient group.",Biomedical Sciences,26/06/2025
"Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia-Associated Fetal Wastage and Meat Quality Compromise in Cattle Slaughtered at Dr Abubakar Saraki Memorial Abattoir, Kwara State, Nigeria","Isaac Dayo Olorunshola, David Sunday Adegboye","Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is still endemic in Nigeria. The Mycoplasma Unit of the Department of Veterinary Microbiology, University of Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria, has completed an 18-month investigation of CBPP cases encountered at the main city abattoir. Investigation was with special emphasis on fetal wastes, physical and health conditions of cattle presented for slaughter at the abattoir. Blood and tissues samples were obtained during ante mortem and postmortem examinations for laboratory investigations and diagnosis of CBPP were based on classical pathological lesions and culture of Mycoplasma organism identified serologically as M. mycoides subsp. mycoides from lung lesions and pleural fluids obtained from the cattle. From a total of 41,069 cattle slaughtered, 40,075 (97.6%) were cows from which 6,699 fetuses were encountered, and 963 (2.3%) were bulls. Thus, an average of 372 fetuses was wastedeach month at the abattoir. Of the 40,075 cows slaughtered, 913 (2.3%) were CBPP-positive and carried 153 fetuses. Most cows carried twin fetuses.We estimate that each fetal wastage is equivalent to 50,000 Naira losses to the farmer, and each emaciated animal slaughtered is a loss of approximately 200,000 Naira.Studies are warranted to determine annual national economic losses resulting from slaughtering emaciated cattle that are often discovered to be pregnant, and propose strategies to address the avoidable revenue loss.",Veterinary Medicine,26/06/2025
Potential of a Powdered Mopane Worms-Breakfast Meal Blend as a Nutritious Porridge for Children in Zambia,"Yongo Salasini, Nixon Miyoba","In Zambia, the intake of animal-sourced proteins remains low in many households, despite their essential role in supporting physical growth, cognitive development in children, and overall health in adults. Among edible insects, Mopane worms are widely consumed and offer a protein content comparable to that of conventional meats. However, there is limited research on incorporating Mopane worms into cereal-based foods such as porridge to enhance their nutritional value, and little is known about the nutritional composition and consumer acceptability of such products. This study investigated the nutritional attributes and consumer acceptance of porridge made from two Mopane worm breakfast meal composite blends and one conventional breakfast meal. Mopane worms (variety Mumpa kaseke) were sourced from Muchinga Province and processed under clean, dry conditions. Two composite blends were formulated following World Food Programme super cereal guidelines: MB80 (80% breakfast meal and 20% Mopane worm powder) and MB75 (75% breakfast meal and 25% Mopane worm powder). The samples were analyzed in triplicate for proximate composition and mineral content (calcium, iron, and zinc) using AOAC (2005) methods. Consumer acceptability was also assessed for the three porridge types. Results indicated that Mopane worm powder had a high protein content (55.60?±?4.01%). The MB80 and MB75 composite blends contained 16.74?±?1.98% and 19.04?±?1.11% protein, respectively. MB75 had higher iron content (1.74?±?0.74%) than MB80 (1.04?±?0.19%), while MB80 had more zinc (0.57?±?0.11%) than MB75 (0.41?±?0.74%). Statistically significant differences (p?<?0.05) were found in proximate and mineral composition across the three samples. Between MB80 and MB75, only moisture, ash, and crude fiber differed significantly. In terms of sensory attributes, consumer acceptability ratings for aroma, taste, and overall preference showed no significant differences (p?<?0.05) among the three porridge types. Similarly, there were no significant differences between MB80 and MB75 in terms of consumer ratings for any attribute. In conclusion, the inclusion of Mopane worm powder into breakfast meals significantly improved the nutritional content of porridge, especially in protein, fat, and fibre, while maintaining consumer acceptability. These findings highlight the potential of insect-based composite flours as a sustainable approach to enhancing dietary protein intake and addressing malnutrition in low-income settings.",Agriculture Sciences,26/06/2025
Systematic Communal Impacts of COVID-19 on Fisheries and Fish Marketing in Nigeria,"Rasheed Yemi Oladunyoje, Oyebamiji Oladeni Fafioye","In 2020, Coronavirus swiftly spread to the world, relentlessly crashing lives and economies. Economic activities were severely affected by the pandemic especially the lockdown policy where transportation during the outbreak was restricted to reduce the spread of the virusin Nigeria. The effects of the pandemic on food and other agricultural sectors were evident as it interferes with supply chain, impaired production and distribution. Impacts of the pandemic on fisheries and fish marketing of Ogun State, Nigeria were assessed. One thousand and two (1,002) fish farmers and nine hundred and sixty-two (962) fish marketers were randomly examined and statistically analysed. Results showed that majority of the respondents believe in the existence of COVID-19 in Nigeria(82.7%) and worrisome of the pandemic as fish farmers can contact it. No significant relationship (p > 0.05) between COVID-19 pandemic and parameters of positive and negative situations of fish farmers/marketers. There were no significant relationship recorded between the pandemic and high profits gained by the fish farmers/marketers as well as increased fish marketing; between COVID-19 pandemic and decrease in fish and fingerlings production and supply; between COVID-19 pandemic and increased cost of fish feed as well as availability of feed ingredients. Significant relationship (p < 0.05) exists between COVID-19 pandemic and the fish demand. Conclusively, COVID-19 lockdown has empirical negative impacts on fisheries and fish marketing such as increased in cost of fish feeds, non-availability of feed ingredients, and decrease in table fish, fingerlings production and supply. FarmersÕ enlightenment on the virus existence (being a zoonotic disease) and safety of fisheries workers,along the supply chain should be a prioritized.",Agriculture Sciences,04/06/2025
Bacterial Contamination Levels in Fresh Fish Fillets Sold in Lusaka District of Zambia,Malifa Mwendelema,"ZambiaÕs aquaculture sector has expanded rapidly, increasing the risk of bacterial zoonotic diseases from fish. This cross-sectional study assessed bacterial contamination in 132 fresh fish filletsÑ69 hake and 63 tilapias Ñ sold in Lusaka District, Zambia, addressing gaps in local fish contamination and antimicrobial resistance. Bacterial isolates were identified through morphological characteristics and biochemical tests, while antibiotic susceptibility was determined using the KirbyÐBauer disc diffusion method. Total viable count (TVC) and faecal coliform analysis showed that 31% of samples exceeded TVC limits, and 45% contained faecal coliforms. Notably, 93% of tilapia fillets were contaminated, while hake fillets showed no faecal contamination. Escherichia coli (53.8%) was the predominant bacterium, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (46.2%), Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Enterobacter. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed broad-spectrum efficacy of chloramphenicol, while Staphylococcus and Serratia species exhibited resistance to penicillin. Ciprofloxacin and doxycycline were largely effective, though one E. coli strain showed resistance. The high contamination levels, particularly in tilapia fillets, pose serious health risks to vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Consumption of contaminated fish could lead to gastrointestinal illness or severe infections. These findings highlight the need for improved aquaculture practices, stricter food safety regulations, and enhanced public awareness on proper fish handling and cooking to mitigate health risks.",Biomedical Sciences,04/06/2025
A Comparative Study of Pharmaceutical and Bio-Equivalence Characteristics of Different Brands of Extended-Release Diclofenac Sodium Marketed in Zambia Using the Mongoloid Dog Model,"Safe Maricky Musonda, Tyson Longwani Muungo","Diclofenac sodium is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound (NSAID) that is used to treat inflammation and manage pain caused by various conditions. In Zambia, numerous generic brands of diclofenac are available on the market, providing prescribers and patients with a wide range of options. This Study compared pharmaceutical and bioequivalence characteristics of three (3) different brands of extended-release diclofenac sodium 100mg tablets marketed in Zambia. An analytical technique was employed to examine physicochemical parameters. The dissolution analysis was conducted using the paddle technique. A randomised, single-dose, two-way crossover design was performed on six Mongoloid female dogs that were fasted. After receiving 100 mg diclofenac sodium tablets orally, the levels of diclofenac in the plasma were determined using UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including the time taken for maximum drug concentration (T-max), maximum drug concentration in plasma after dosing (C-max), area under the curve from 0 to 10 (AUC 0-10), and area under the curve infinity (AUC °), were determined through a non-compartmental procedure. The physicochemical characteristics were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA), while Bioequivalence was assessed using the linear-log trapezoidal rule method. The non-aqueous titration showed that the purity of diclofenac ranged from 95.41% to 102.8% w/w. All brands were well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, and the parameters were within the acceptable range set by the FDA for Bioequivalence. The 100 mg diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets from three brands had good physical and chemical properties and met the criteria for drug release. However, there were noticeable differences in the AUC0-10hrs between brand A and brands B and C, suggesting that while the brands are chemically similar, they are not equal in terms of biological equivalence.",Biomedical Sciences,04/06/2025
"A Case Report of Argulosis at a Recreational Fishing Dam in Lusaka, Zambia","Zainul Abeden Bhura, Sipiwe Ndhlovu","This study reports the first confirmed outbreak of argulosis in Zambia, involving multiple fish species at a recreational fishing dam in Lusaka. Argulus spp. (fish lice), ectoparasitic crustaceans known for their broad host range and pathogenicity, were identified as the causative agents. Six fish species, both indigenous and introduced, exhibited clinical signs such as erratic swimming and surface rubbing, with post-mortem examinations revealing characteristic lesions including skin ulcers and parasite-laden gills. Morphological analysis confirmed the presence of Argulus spp. Environmental stressors, high fish stocking densities, and unregulated fish transfers were identified as potential drivers of the outbreak. The findings highlight the growing risk of parasite emergence in managed aquatic systems across sub-Saharan Africa. Recommendations include enhancing biosecurity, routine surveillance, rapid response protocols, public awareness, and targeted research to mitigate future outbreaks and safeguard fish health and biodiversity.",Veterinary Medicine,04/06/2025
Sweet but Toxic: Organophosphate Pesticide Residues in Nigerian Honey as an Emerging Threat to Food Safety and Agriculture,Olufela Ogunbo,"Honey, despite its nutritional and therapeutic properties, can pose significant risks to environmental health and food safety due to the presence of contaminants. This study investigated the occurrence of organophosphate pesticide residues in honey samples collected from hard-to-reach apiaries in Nigeria and examined the relationship between these residues, honey purity, and nutritional composition. Multiple organophosphate residues were detected using Gas ChromatographyÐMass Spectrometry, with dimethoate and merphor being the most prevalent. Although all detected concentrations were below the maximum residue limits (MRLs) set by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), some values, particularly dimethoate from Imosan, approached the regulatory thresholds. Nutritional analysis revealed that the protein, moisture, ash, and sugar contents of the honey samples generally fell within international quality standards. Statistical correlations indicated strong associations between honey purity and pesticide residues, as well as with moisture and dry matter content. This study underscores the need for continuous monitoring of pesticide residues in apicultural products and highlights potential implications for food safety and public health.",General,04/06/2025
Optimization of the production process and nutritional composition of Zambian Munkoyo and Chibwantu Non-Alcoholic Beverages,,"This study investigated the optimization of production procedures and nutritional content of Munkoyo and Chibwantu, traditional Zambian non-alcoholic beverages. Key production parameters, such as, pH, Total Titratable Acidity, viscosity, and Total Soluble Solids were evaluated for optimization, while analyses for proximate composition, calcium, iron, and zinc were conducted to assess nutrient content. Results revealed no significant differences in fermentation outcomes between extracts from 100 g and 150 g of dried Munkoyo root (p > 0.05), with pH levels ranging from 3.53 to 3.77 and TTA below 1%. Nutritional analyses indicated that Munkoyo contains 2.7 to 4.1 mg/100 g of calcium, 0.04 to 0.05 mg/100 g of iron, and 0.19 to 0.38 mg/100 g of zinc, while Chibwantu provides 2.4 to 4.7 mg/100 g of calcium, 0.03 to 0.05 mg/100 g of iron, and 0.25 to 0.46 mg/100 g of zinc. The low mineral content suggests supplementation with nutrient-rich ingredients. This research lays a foundation for quality standards and supports the sustainability of Munkoyo root, aiding the growth of Zambia's traditional beverage market.",Agriculture Sciences,25/05/2025
Antimicrobial Potential of Combretum molle Leaf Extracts: Insights from Zambia,,"The global rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) necessitates innovative solutions. This study investigates the antimicrobial activity and phytochemical composition of Combretum molle, a native Zambian plant, to explore its potential as a cost-effective source for novel antimicrobial agents. Exhaustive extraction using solvents of varying polarities was performed on dried leaf extracts of C. molle. These extracts were tested against a panel of clinically significant gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and screened for phytochemicals. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of steroids, terpenoids, phenols, flavonoids, tannins, saponins, alkaloids, and glycosides. Antimicrobial activity was assessed using disk diffusion and broth microdilution techniques, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined through spectrophotometry and spot inoculation. The results revealed substantial antimicrobial activity, with hexane extracts showing the highest efficacy (MIC range: 3.6 to 50.4 mg/ml) and ethanol extracts exhibiting comparable activity to tetracycline (inhibition zones: 6 to 26 mm, P-value < 0.05). These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of C. molle extracts and support their possible integration into ethnomedicine as alternatives to conventional antimicrobials. By tapping into nature's arsenal, this study contributes to the search for effective strategies against multi-drug resistance, offering hope in the fight against AMR.",Biomedical Sciences,27/05/2025
"Evaluation of Smallholder Dairy FarmersÕ Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices and Factors Contributing to Hygienic Production of Raw Milk in MalawiÕs Blantyre Agriculture Development Division",,"Dairy products provide nutrition to households but, could also serve as a source of many milk-borne diseases when produced under poor hygiene conditions. This quantitative, cross-sectional study administered 410 questionnaires, collected 90 raw milk samples and visited 90 farms to evaluate hygienic milk production practices in MalawiÕs Blantyre Agriculture Development Division (BLADD). Descriptive statistics were used to summarise questionnaire, farm and laboratory observations data.The majority of farmers 86% and 66.6% (n=410) had formal education and structured pre-training in hygienic milk production respectively. The overall KAP knowledge was only 54%, most smallholder dairy farmers reported positive attitudes at 88% and excellent practices at 63%. Few farmers (27.1%; n=410) had low aggregate score of knowledge, attitude and practice were six (OR=5.910, 95% CI: 1.997-17.489) times less likely to produce hygienic milk. Inadequate pre-training and a low aggregate score were identified as key factors behind the failure of smallholder farmers in MalawiÕs BLADD to meet Malawian and European Union (EU) standards, raising concerns about potential milk-borne diseases. Out of 90 raw milk samples analyzed for presence of E. coli, 11 (12%) and 50 (55.5%) raw milk samples were within acceptable limits of Malawian and European Union standards respectively. These low percentages obtained could be attributed to unsanitary animal quarters, as half of smallholder dairy farmers in MalawiÕs Blantyre Agriculture Development Division do not remove waste daily and some workers milk cows without supervision. In conclusion, smallholder dairy farmers had positive attitudes and good milk hygiene practices without grounded knowledge and it was difficult to meet legal limits of Malawi and European Union Standards for E. coli. Therefore, regular ongoing annual refresher farm management trainings and monitoring of hazards in raw milk production are important for safe milk",Biomedical Sciences,27/05/2025
A case of 4-year-old Female sheep-Goat Hybrid Born Under Natural Conditions in Namibia,,"This article reports a 4 year old female sheep x goat interspecific hybrid born under natural conditions in Namibia. Repetitive DNA sequencing using microsatellite markers was used to confirm the hybrid. Morphological characteristics of the sheep-goat hybrid had higher parameters in terms of heart girth, height at withers and trunk length compared to other animals in the flock. The weight of hybrid was 74 kg while the weight of its dam, a goat doe, was 42 kg and the possible sire, a sheep ram, weighed 51 kg. The hybrid had long and thick tail, a head resembling a sheep whereas its skin, horns, and teats were like those of a goat and its legs were relatively long. The hybrid conceived on two occasions with a buck, but aborted at about 4 months into the pregnancy. The hybrid in terms of body weight and dimensions was bigger than common goats and sheep found in the rural livestock traditional farming area of the region possibly indicating hybrid vigour. The hybridÕs large size brings hope about need of more research and breeding and the possibility towards cloning of such animals using nuclear transfer technology for increased meat production in future. The authors believe this is the first documented report of a sheep-goat hybrid from Namibia, and third in Africa, that lived normally for a long time to full adulthood and even conceived, even though the conceptus was aborted.",Veterinary Medicine,27/05/2025
"Biosecurity Knowledge, Attitude and Practices in Cage Aquaculture: A Study of Fish Health and Disease Risk Management on Lake Kariba, Siavonga, Zambia",,"Cage aquaculture in Lake Kariba, Zambia, is critical to the regionÕs fish production but faces significant challenges in disease outbreaks. This study assessed the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) of aquaculture producers in Siavonga concerning fish health and disease risk management. Data were collected through structured interviews with 14 producers, representing small, medium, and large-scale farms. The study aimed to identify gaps in biosecurity awareness and practices, particularly in relation to disease prevention and control. The results showed that knowledge of biosecurity and disease risks was predominantly low across all farm scales. Specifically, 90% of small-scale producers and 100% of medium-scale producers exhibited low knowledge, while 50% of large-scale producers showed low knowledge. Attitudes toward biosecurity were generally negative, with 90% of small-scale producers holding negative attitudes, compared to 50% of large-scale producers who demonstrated positive attitudes. The implementation of disease management practices was more consistent in medium- and large-scale operations, with 100% of large-scale farms following moderate to good practices, compared to 100% poor practices in small-scale farms. Significant gaps in adherence to best biosecurity practices were observed, particularly in small-scale farms. For instance, 60% of small-scale farms did not follow quarantine procedures, and only 20% assessed disease risks pre-movement. In contrast, 100% of large-scale farms implemented quarantine measures and assessed disease risks before moving fish. This study highlights the need for targeted interventions to improve biosecurity knowledge and practices, especially among small-scale producers, who constitute 71.4% of the respondents. Training, resource allocation, and policy enforcement are crucial to addressing these gaps and mitigating the risk of disease outbreaks that threaten the aquaculture sectorÕs sustainability in Lake Kariba.",Veterinary Medicine,25/05/2025
"Malaria Transmitting Anophiline Mosquito Larva in Fishponds of Mongu District, Western Province of Zambia",,"Mongu District, situated in the malaria-endemic Western Province of Zambia, has witnessed a significant increase in fish farming activities in recent years. These practices have brought substantial economic and nutritional benefits to the local population, offering an alternative source of income and food security. However, poorly managed fishponds have emerged as potential breeding grounds for Anopheles mosquitoes, the primary vectors responsible for malaria transmission. This poses a dual challenge of promoting sustainable aquaculture while mitigating associated public health risks. This study aimed to investigate whether mosquito larvae found in fishponds within Mongu District belonged to malaria-transmitting Anopheline species. A total of 26 fishponds were surveyed across the district, with larvae samples collected, preserved, and subjected to detailed morphological identification at the Macha Research Trust. The findings revealed the presence of Anopheline mosquito larvae, which have the potential to mature into adult vectors of malaria. Crucially, unlined fishponds were identified as hotspots for mosquito breeding, whereas lined ponds were completely devoid of larvae. These observations underscore the role of proper fishpond design and management in reducing mosquito proliferation. The study further highlights the effectiveness of lined ponds, which not only enhance water retention and fish productivity but also serve as a barrier against mosquito breeding. Additionally, the introduction of larvivorous fish speciesÑfish that feed on mosquito larvaeÑwas identified as a sustainable biological control measure to reduce malaria transmission risks associated with aquaculture. These findings underscore the urgent need for integrated strategies that balance the economic benefits of fish farming with the imperative of malaria control. Recommendations include promoting the adoption of lined fishponds, training local farmers in best aquaculture practices, and encouraging the use of biological mosquito control methods such as larvivorous fish. Policymakers, public health officials, and aquaculture stakeholders must collaborate to ensure that fish farming contributes positively to livelihoods without exacerbating public health challenges. This study serves as a critical reminder that the intersection of aquaculture and public health requires a coordinated approach to ensure sustainable development in malaria-endemic regions like Mongu District.",Biomedical Sciences,05/05/2025
"Evaluating Non-Antibiotic Therapeutic Strategies for Controlling Lactococcosis in Nile Tilapia: Investigating the Efficacy of Aloe Vera Extracts, Vitamin D and Selenium Supplement, and Probiotics in Experimental Infections",,"This study investigated non-antibiotic therapeutic strategies for controlling lactococcosis in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The efficacy of Aloe vera extract, Vitamin E/Selenium supplementation, and multi-strain probiotics was evaluated against Lactococcus garvieae infection in an experimental setting. Two hundred Nile tilapia were divided into four groups: control, Aloe vera, Vitamin E/Selenium, and probiotic. After a 42-day treatment period, fish were challenged with L. garvieae and monitored for 28 days. Clinical signs, mortality rates, and survival were assessed. The control group exhibited severe disease progression with 100% mortality by day 21 post-infection. Aloe vera treatment reduced mortality to 20%, showing moderate efficacy. Vitamin E/Selenium supplementation provided greater protection with only 5% mortality. The probiotic-treated group demonstrated the most remarkable results, with no clinical signs or mortalities throughout the study. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between treatment groups and the control, with probiotics showing the largest effect size (Cohen's d = 0.98, p < 0.001), followed by Vitamin E/Selenium (Cohen's d = 0.9, p = 0.001) and Aloe vera (Cohen's d = 0.74, p = 0.003). These findings highlight the potential of non-antibiotic interventions in managing L. garvieae infections, with probiotics emerging as the most effective treatment.

"Factors Influencing the Selection of Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine as a Preferred Programme of Study among the University of Zambia Veterinary Students, Zambia",,"Career selection is a very crucial and critical stage in one's life, it demands consideration of many factors. In the past making career choices was not difficult and dependent on family background, which could have led to job dissatisfaction. Making a career choice in veterinary medicine was more challenging because veterinary medicine was considered a masculine job and thus discriminated against women. However, veterinary medicine now offers multifaceted career prospects that cut across gender and race. This study was aimed at identifying factors that influenced enrolled veterinary students at the University of Zambia students in selecting the Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine (BVM) as the preferred program of study; and to asses the challenges faced by the students. This was a cross-sectional study conducted among veterinary students from 2nd to 6th (final) year students regardless of age or gender. A total of 145 students were enrolled and a semi-structured questionnaire was administered to each participant to collect demographic, socioeconomic and environmental factors hypothesized to influence selection of Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine as the program of choice. Data was summarised into proportions and presented in percentages. A total of 135 participants completed the questionnaire in full, with 51% of respondents being females. Several factors were observed to have influenced career choice among the veterinary students, however, majority (46%; 62/135) of students indicated that they were personally interested in the programme and loved working with animals. It was further noted that parents and friends were the main source of information regarding the BVM programme, indicating the need for the University to provide complete information to prospective students so that they can make informed decisions. Workload was the was the major challenge the students indicated in their pursuit of the degree. The study findings indicate the University of Zambia needs to device ways to communicate to prospective students to ensure that they have complete and current information on programmes on offer to avoid misinformation which is likely among peers and if coming from uniformed third parties. The findings also agree with literature indicating work overload as one of the challenges veterinary students face in their pursuit for the degree.",Veterinary Medicine,05/05/2025
"Distribution of Microsporidia spp. in Tick Species in Cattle in Parts of Ogun State, Southwestern Nigeria",,"Frequent contacts between tick-infested cattle and living hosts (ticks), enables the role cattle plays in the transmission of Microsporidia spp. among the animals. This cross-sectional study evaluated the presence of Microsporidia spp. in tick species on traded cattle in six cattle farms in some parts of Ogun State, South-western part of Nigeria. A total of five hundred and thirty-five (535) ticks were hand-picked from various parts of the body on cattle from the study area. The hand-picked ticks were identified and screened for the presence of Microsporidia spores. Chi-square and logistic regression model were analysed using R software with p < 0.05 being set as significance. Results showed that out of the 535 ticks sampled, an overall 280 (52.3%) were detected to be infected with Microsporidia spp. Among the tick species, Amblyomma variegatum 103 (55.1%) and Dermacentor nitens 24(42.1%) had the highest and lowest prevalence rates for microsporidiosis respectively. Majority of the infections (69.2%) were found in cattle in Abeokuta-North Local Government Area with p < 0.05 across the cattle farms in the study area. Lastly, Microsporidia spp. was twice as likely to infect ticks on cattle in Ikenne and Ijebu-North Local Government Areas (p<0.05). In conclusion, the study revealed that tick species found on cattle in Ogun State are home to Microsporidia spp. and it is recommended that sensitization programs on ticks menace to cattle traders be embarked on by stakeholders and veterinarians in Ogun State without exacerbating public health challenges.
